<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the English trading settlement in Japan in the first quarter
  of the seventeenth century is the history of a failure; and the causes
  of the failure are not far to seek. Choosing for their dep√¥t an insignificant
  island in the extreme west of the kingdom, without even good anchorage
  to recommend it, and at a far distance from the capital cities of Miako
  and Yedo, with the Dutch for their neighbours and, as it proved, their
  rivals, the English may be said to have courted disaster. It is true
  that Firando was a ready port for shipping coming from Europe; its
  ruler was friendly; and it lay in a convenient position from whence
  to open the much-desired trade with China. And the policy of making
  common cause with the Protestant Hollanders against the Spaniards and
  Portuguese, who had first secured a footing in Japan and were powerful
  in the neighbouring town of Nagasaki, would have been a sound one,
  had the latter remained supreme. But, when the English landed, the
  Dutch had already obtained privileges and had established their trade
  in the country; and what ought to have been foreseen inevitably came
  to pass. The Dutch were not allies; they were rivals, who undersold
  the English in the market and in the end starved them out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span> country. Possibly, if our countrymen had been allowed
  to maintain the branch factories which they started in some of the
  principal towns, they might have held their own against their rivals,
  in spite of the limited trade which Japan afforded; but when their
  privileges were curtailed and they were restricted to Firando, their
  case became desperate.</p>
<p>Purchas, in his <i>Pilgrimes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has
  told us the story of the first landing of the English and its causes.
  The present volumes give us the internal history of the factory. The
  original diary of Richard Cocks, the chief factor, once formed part
  of those papers of the East India Company, whose luckless fate it was
  to be destroyed or cast out of their home in Leadenhall-street to wander
  through the world. Happily the diary escaped many perils, and now rests
  in the British Museum, where, bound in two volumes, it bears the numbers,
  Additional MSS. 31,300, 31,301. Unfortunately it is not complete. It
  runs from 1st June, 1615, to 14th January, 1619, and from 5th December,
  1620, to 24th March, 1622; but it has lost nothing since it left the
  Company&rsquo;s archives.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span> I have not thought it necessary to print the whole
  of it; but only those entries which have absolutely no interest, <i>e.g.</i> bare
  memoranda of sales and purchases, have been omitted. As a supplement,
  to illustrate the diary and to fill in the periods which are wanting
  therein, I have added in an Appendix a selection from the letters of
  Cocks and others, chiefly from the archives of the India Office.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>Our early connection with Japan forms perhaps one of the most interesting
  episodes in our mercantile history, and has a share of romance imparted
  to it by the story of the English sailor whose name is so intimately
  associated with it. William Adams, &ldquo;a Kentish man, born in a town
  called Gillingham, two English miles from Rochester, one mile from
  Chatham where the king&rsquo;s ships do lie&rdquo;,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a
  seafaring man who had served in the English navy, joined, as senior
  pilot, one of the Dutch trading fleets which sailed for the East in
  1598. Weighing anchor in June, Adams and his companions encountered
  misfortune and delay on the coast of Africa, so that it was not till
  April of the next year that they reached the Straits of Magellan, where
  they were forced to pass the winter. Hence they made for Peru; and
  after sundry adventures, in which the fleet was dispersed and the <i>Charity</i>,
  the ship wherein Adams sailed, lost the greater part of her crew, the
  latter vessel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> company with a single consort struck across for Japan.
  But bad fortune still waited on the unlucky voyagers. The consort foundered
  in a storm; and Adams&rsquo;s ship with difficulty reached the shores of
  the province of Bungo, in the island of Kiushiu, in Japan, where she
  let fall her anchor on the 19th of April, 1600. Her crew was reduced
  to four-and-twenty, all told; and of these only some half-dozen were
  able to stand on their feet. Of the latter Adams was one, and was selected
  to be sent up to the court of Iy√©yasu, the famous soldier who then
  ruled Japan.</p>
<p>The moment at which Adams set foot in this unknown land was a critical
  one in the history of the country. The dual form of government, by
  mikado and shogun, had been in existence some four hundred years. In
  the twelfth century, at a time when Japan was torn by internal wars
  and dissensions, the military chief Yoritomo had risen to power and,
  overthrowing his enemies, had set up the military despotism which,
  acting in the name of the powerless mikado, ruled the whole country.
  In 1192 Yoritomo received from the mikado the title of Sei-i Tai Shogun
  (Barbarian-subjugating Great General); and henceforth that title was
  transmitted to the <i>de facto</i> rulers, and lasted down to the revolution
  of 1868. The mikado, the rightful emperor of Japan, became a mere cipher,
  living in the seclusion of his palace, neglected and often in poverty.</p>
<p>This peculiar system has naturally perplexed foreigners; and thus it is
  that the mikado, or dairi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span> as he is more usually called by the early European writers,
  is represented as the spiritual head,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> while
  the shogun, or military ruler for the time being, is always styled
  the emperor.</p>
<p>Two families, the Hojo and the Ashikaga, successively held the shogunate
  down to the year 1573. The last shogun of the second house was deposed
  by Nobunaga, the son of a soldier of fortune, whose name, like those
  of his two generals and successors, Hid√©yoshi and Iy√©yasu, is great
  in Japanese history. Nobunaga fell the victim of treachery; but his
  place was promptly filled by Hid√©yoshi, who at once crushed the rising
  which had overthrown his master and assumed the reins of government.
  The son of a peasant, he had entered Nobunaga&rsquo;s service as a groom,
  but, attracting notice, he was promoted to military service and quickly
  rose by his own prowess to high command. Often changing his name, according
  to Japanese custom, he appears in history under many designations.
  By the Portuguese Jesuits he is referred to as Faxiba (<i>i.e.</i> Hashiba);
  but he is more generally known by his later name of Taiko Sama; and
  by this name he is called in these volumes. Neither he nor Nobunaga
  received the title of shogun. The highest rank to which he attained
  was that of kuwambaku, or premier.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p>Hid√©yoshi died in 1598<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> leaving an infant son, Hid√©yori (the Fidaia
  Sama of Cocks&rsquo;s diary), whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> he had married to the grand-daughter of his old fellow-soldier
  Iy√©yasu, in the hope of thus disarming a dangerous rival, who was also
  appointed one of the guardians of the boy. But these precautions went
  for nothing. Even in Nobunaga&rsquo;s days Iy√©yasu was a powerful leader,
  and he had only submitted to Taiko Sama after some hesitation. It is
  true that he swore to protect the interests of the young Hid√©yori;
  but many circumstances combined to stifle any scruples that he might
  have felt in supplanting his ward. It was whispered that the child
  was no son of Taiko Sama, and, even if he were, the nobles who had
  resented the rule of the low-born chief, whom they were forced to obey,
  were not disposed to continue their submission to his child. What has
  always happened in such conjunctures was sure to happen now. The other
  guardians of the young prince, suspicious of Iy√©yasu, began to draw
  together their troops; Iy√©yasu summoned his men; and soon after, in
  October, 1600, the rival armies confronted each other on the field
  of S√©kigahara, near Lake Biwa, in the centre of the kingdom. Iy√©yasu
  gained a decisive victory; his enemies were scattered with fearful
  slaughter; and the young Hid√©yori was at the mercy of the conqueror.
  To the credit of the latter, his captive received no harm, but continued
  to lead a life of almost perfect freedom in his strong castle of Ozaka.</p>
<p>It was, then, only a few months before this decisive battle that Adams
  had his first interview with Iy√©yasu, the emperor as he styles him,
  at Ozaka. How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> he found favour in his eyes, was taken into his confidence,
  &ldquo;learned him some points of geometry and understanding of the
  arts of mathematics&rdquo;, built him ships and, in fine, gained such
  influence that &ldquo;what I said he would not contrary,&rdquo; Adams
  himself has told us in that letter which, a captive in a far-off land,
  he addressed so pathetically to his &ldquo;unknown friends and countrymen.&rdquo; But
  when, in his yearning to see wife and children again, &ldquo;according
  to conscience and nature&rdquo;, he prayed for liberty to return to
  his country, Iy√©yasu hardened his heart and would not let him go. The
  most that was granted was leave for the Dutch captain of the ship<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
  one of the crew to depart. This they did; and it should be noted that
  it was by the help of the daimio of Firando, who now first appears
  upon the scene, that they found a junk wherein to sail. The captain
  was soon after killed fighting against the Portuguese. His companion
  returned and settled at Nagasaki, being the Melchor van Sanfort (or
  Sanvoort) whom we meet in the diary. Others of the crew no doubt settled
  in the country. One of them is incidentally mentioned by Cocks (i.
  171).</p>
<p>Adams&rsquo;s letter above referred to was written in October, 1611. It reached
  the English factory at Bantam probably early in 1612; but the idea
  of opening trade with Japan had already been entertained in England.
  Adams&rsquo;s story was known there by reports from the Dutch; and letters
  announcing the intentions of the East India Company were sent out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> him by the ship <i>Globe</i>, which sailed in January,
  1611. In April following, the <i>Clove</i>, the <i>Thomas</i>, and
  the <i>Hector</i> were despatched under command of Captain John Saris,
  with letters from King James I. to the Emperor of Japan. Arriving at
  Bantam in October, 1612, Saris remained there till the beginning of
  the new year, and then, on the 14th of January, sailed for Japan in
  the ship <i>Clove</i>, with a crew of some seventy men. On the 10th
  of June, off Nagasaki, he first sighted the western coast of Kiushiu,
  and two days after came to an anchor in the haven of Firando.</p>
<p>The first to greet the English commander were the old daimio or tono,
  Foyne Sama, then in his seventy-second year, and his grandson, a young
  man of two-and-twenty, who shared the government. Both are styled kings;
  and the latter is Figen a (or Figeno) Sama, who appears throughout
  Cocks&rsquo;s diary as the king of Firando. Foyne Sama seems to have been
  a simple and unaffected old man, not averse to merry-making, but firm,
  and, says Saris, &ldquo;famed to be the worthiest soldier of all Japan,
  for his valour and service in the Cor&#275;an wars.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Old
  as he was and good-humoured as he appeared, we see something of the
  sterner side of his character in certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> remarks of our diarist. Almost immediately after their
  arrival the English sailors began quarrelling and drew from him a reproof
  which, though gentle, was a sufficient hint; and we are told, at a
  later date, when his dog &ldquo;Balle&rdquo; was accidentally killed
  by the English cook, that &ldquo;if this had happened in the time of
  Foyne Sama, who esteemed this dog much, it might have cost us all our
  lives&rdquo; (i. 248). The readiness with which he welcomed and encouraged
  foreign trade is creditable, and proves that he understood, at all
  events in some degree, the benefits which his small principality might
  derive from it. He died in 1614, about a year after the establishment
  of the English factory. The young king had not the force of character
  of his grandfather. Though generally keeping on fair terms with the
  English, his temper was capricious, and he was probably too indolent
  not to be ruled by his own ministers, some of whom appear to have been
  all-powerful. The principal nobles and ministers at Firando were: Bongo
  Sama or Nobesane, Foyne&rsquo;s brother, and consequently great-uncle to
  Figen a Sama; Tonomon Sama, and Genta or Gentero Sama, Figen a Sama&rsquo;s
  brothers, of whom the first acted as viceroy in the absence of the
  king, and the second resided as hostage at the shogun&rsquo;s court and was
  in favour there; Sangero Sama, a natural son of Foyne; Oyen Dono<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
  Semi Dono, the royal secretaries; and Taccamon Dono, the chief justice, &ldquo;our
  enemy&rdquo;, as Cocks calls him (ii. 3).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
The Dutch had already been settled in Firando for some years. In July,
  1609, their ship the <i>Red Lion</i> arrived in that port and, favoured
  by Foyne Sama, they succeeded in obtaining from the shogun leave to
  establish a factory and to send one or more ships annually from Europe.
  It was not, however, till two years after this that another small ship,
  the <i>Brach</i>, arrived, and two commissioners were sent up to pay
  the usual visit to the court. One of these was Jacob Speck,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> afterwards
  head of the Dutch factory and the contemporary and rival of Cocks.
  At the court at Suruga they were met by William Adams, whose influence
  with the shogun was used to such good purpose that they received most
  favourable terms for trading in the country, while two embassies of
  the Portuguese and Spaniards, which were present about the same time,
  failed to obtain the full privileges they sought.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
  head of the Dutch factory, when Saris landed, was Hendrik Brower; and
  at the very first mention of his name by Cocks, the jealousy which
  was smouldering in the hearts of the two nations shows itself: &ldquo;Captain
  Brower went along by the door but would not look at us, and we made
  as little account of him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p>The first business for Saris to transact was the hire of a house, to serve
  for a factory, from Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> Andassee, &ldquo;Captain of the China quarter&rdquo;,
  the Chinaman who appears all through the diary by the name of Andrea
  Dittis; his next was to prepare to visit the court of Iy√©yasu, only
  waiting to be joined by William Adams, for whom he had sent and who
  arrived on the 29th of July. They started on their journey on the 7th
  of August, leaving Cocks to manage affairs at Firando, and travelled
  by the same regular route over which Cocks was afterwards so often
  to pass: down the inland sea to Ozaka, and thence by land to Suruga<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> where
  Iy√©yasu resided, and afterwards proceeding to Yedo to visit Hid√©tada,
  son of the latter and actual shogun, to whom his father, according
  to a not infrequent custom, had transferred the title in 1605. It is
  needless to repeat here the interesting details of this journey, which
  are to be found in Saris&rsquo;s own narrative in the pages of Purchas. For
  our present purpose it is enough to state that the travellers returned
  to Firando on the 6th of November with ample privileges for trade.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> One
  request was however refused, viz. the right to bring into Japan and
  sell the goods of Chinese prizes which might be captured as a punishment
  for rejection of the English trade. This is only one of several instances
  that are recorded of Iy√©yasu&rsquo;s fairness to all foreigners alike and
  of his refusal to mix in their quarrels. It was also understood that,
  on the arrival of a ship from Europe, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> present was to be carried to the shogun; and for trade
  with neighbouring countries a goshon or licence was requisite for each
  junk that sailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now touching a factory to be left there,&rdquo; says Saris, &ldquo;I
  had on the twenty-sixth [of November] assembled my merchandizing council,
  where, upon these considerations, viz. the encouragement we had received
  in the Moluccas by private intelligence; the Dutch factory already
  planted here in Firando; the large privileges now obtained of the Emperor
  of Japan; the certain advice of the English factories settled in Siam
  and Patane; the commodities resting unsold upon our hands appointed
  for these parts; and the hoped-for profit which further experience
  may produce, it was resolved that a factory should be left there, viz.
  eight English, three Japan jurebasses or interpreters, and two servants,
  who were appointed against the coming of the next ships to search and
  discover the coast of Corea, Tushmay, and other parts of Japan and
  countries thereunto adjoining, to see what good might be done in any
  of them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
  eight Englishmen who were thus appointed members of the English factory,
  were: Richard Cocks, captain and cape- (or head-) merchant, William
  Adams, Tempest Peacock, Richard Wickham, William Eaton, Walter Carwarden,
  Edmund Sayers, and William Nealson.</p>
<p>Richard Cocks<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was
  probably a native of Coventry;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> at all events he was familiar with that city (i. 172),
  and had friends there (i. 229). His name appears in the charter of
  incorporation of the East India Company, 31 Dec. 1600; and in the earlier
  list of
  &ldquo;names of such persons as have written with their own hands to
  venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies,&rdquo; 22 Sept.
  1599, he is described as a grocer and subscribes ¬£200.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He
  himself tells us (ii. 317) that, besides being a member of &ldquo;this
  Right Honourable and Right Worshipful Society or Company which trade
  to the East Indies,&rdquo; he belonged to the Merchants Adventurers
  and was &ldquo;made free of the old Hanse&rdquo;, and he was also a member
  of the Clothworkers&rsquo; Company. A certain Richard Cocks who sailed with
  Frobisher in his third voyage to Meta Incognita, in 1578, and who was
  distinguished as &ldquo;the first to sail in among the ice&rdquo;, was
  probably a relative.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> From
  1603 to 1608 he lived at Bayonne, no doubt as a merchant. Many news-letters
  written by him from thence are preserved in the Public Record Office,
  addressed to Sir Thomas Wilson, secretary to Lord Treasurer Salisbury.
  From this we may infer that Sir Thomas was Cocks&rsquo;s patron. The correspondence
  was continued when Cocks was in Japan; and some of his letters which
  dwelt on the wonders of the country were sent to King James to read,
  who declared them to contain &ldquo;the loudest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span> lies that he had ever heard.&rdquo; Wilson pronounces
  the writer to be, though not lettered, a man of honesty, years, and
  judgment.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> As
  Cocks becomes well known to us as we read his diary, we will leave
  him for the present.</p>
<p>Of the other members of the factory, two soon disappeared from the scene.
  Tempest Peacock and Walter Carwarden went on a trading venture to Cochinchina,
  and, as we shall see, never returned. Richard Wickham appears to have
  been in more independent circumstances than the rest. Even before Saris&rsquo;s
  departure he began to give trouble, as his time of agreement with the
  Company had nearly expired and he bargained for higher wages. He resigned
  his place and left Japan early in 1618, and died soon after at Jacatra
  in Java, worth, it was said, ¬£5,000 or ¬£6,000. William Eaton and Edmund Sayers<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> were
  with the factory from first to last. The former is called by Cocks &ldquo;my
  countryman&rdquo;, probably meaning that they were natives of the same
  place or district. William Nealson was turbulent and quarrelsome, particularly
  when drink put him into his &ldquo;fustian fumes&rdquo;. He died in March,
  1620,
  &ldquo;being wasted away with a consumption.&rdquo; After reading of
  their constant bickerings, one smiles to find that he made Cocks his
  heir; and, piously adds Cocks, &ldquo;if God had called me in his mercy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> before Mr. Nealson, then had he had as much of mine&rdquo; (ii.
  321).</p>
<p>When Adams accompanied Saris to court, he had at length got leave from
  Iy√©yasu to visit his native land. Why he did not choose to sail in
  the <i>Clove</i>, as he at first intended, was, he himself tells us,
  because of &ldquo;some discourtesies offered me by the general.&rdquo; In
  fact, Saris seems to have disagreed with him on several points, and
  did not treat him generously. But, perhaps, a better reason for his
  stay was that which Cocks gives: &ldquo;that he was loth to return to
  his country a beggar&rdquo;; for, although Iy√©yasu had given him an
  estate of some extent, he was ill provided with money. And yet another
  and nobler reason may have influenced him. &ldquo;In my simple judgment,&rdquo; he
  says in one of his letters, &ldquo;if the north-west passage be ever
  discovered, it will be discovered by this way of Japan&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
  Cocks adds,
  &ldquo;Mr. Adams is of the opinion that, if ever the north-east or north-west
  passages be found out, it must be from these parts, and offereth his
  best services therein, the Emperor promising his best furtherance with
  men or letters of recommendation to all princes, and hath entrance
  already into an island called Yedzo, which is thought to be rather
  some part of the continent of Tartaria&rdquo; (ii. 258). So Adams took
  service with the Company, after some haggling over the amount of his
  wages, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span> two years;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
  constantly appears in the course of the diary in various employments.
  Cocks was evidently a little afraid of him, and, while praising him
  to the Company as &ldquo;tractable and willing to do your Worships the
  best service he may,&rdquo; he cautions Wickham to &ldquo;have a due
  care to give Capt. Adams content, which you may easily do if you use
  him with kind speeches and fall not into terms with him upon any argument.
  I am persuaded,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;I could live with him seven years
  before any extraordinary speeches should happen betwixt us.&rdquo; Our
  Cocks doth protest too much. Adams&rsquo;s friendliness to his old comrades
  the Dutch is ever a thorn in the side of the cape-merchant: &ldquo;I
  cannot choose but note it down that both I myself and all the rest
  of our nation do see that he is much more friend to the Dutch than
  to the Englishmen, which are his own countrymen, God forgive him.&rdquo; But,
  in spite of occasional outbursts of this nature, they lived generally
  on friendly terms, and there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of
  Cocks&rsquo;s sorrow when his comrade died.</p>
<p>Two others joined the factory at a later date. John Osterwick, of Dutch
  descent and a kinsman of Wickham, came out in 1615 and remained to
  the end. Richard Hudson, whom Cocks in 1617 calls a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> boy, and who had lost father and brother in the search
  for the north-west passage, was employed as an unattached servant at
  the factory.</p>
<p>Saris sailed from Japan on the 5th of December, 1613. The merchandise
  which stocked the factory consisted chiefly of broad cloth and woollen
  and cotton piece goods; also of Bantam pepper, gunpowder, lead, tin,
  etc. Its total value was about
  ¬£5,650. The Company was sanguine enough, on Saris&rsquo;s representation,
  to hope for such success in the Japan trade, as to be able to export
  silver in sufficient quantity to maintain their Indian trade. But Saris&rsquo;s
  estimate of the mercantile prospects was based on false premises. When
  he arrived, the prices of imports were extraordinarily high; but then
  the Dutch had the market nearly all to themselves, and the demand for
  European goods was almost too limited to give room for competition.
  Steel and lead alone among metals, and silk among materials, sold readily.
  Saris indeed had tried to arrange with the Dutch factor on a profitable
  price, at which both nations should sell their cloth; but the latter
  immediately
  &ldquo;shipped away great store of cloth to divers islands, rating them
  at base prices that he might procure the more speedy despatch of his
  own, and glut the place before the coming of ours.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But
  even apart from Dutch competition, cloth was not a favourite article
  of trade in Japan. Saris soon found that the natives were backward
  in buying, especially when they saw that the English themselves did
  not wear the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span> material they recommended, &ldquo;for, said they,
  you commend your cloth unto us, but you yourselves wear least thereof,
  the better sort of you wearing silken garments, the meaner fustians.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Cocks,
  too, naively remarks that the people of Japan are &ldquo;so addicted
  to silks that they do not enter into consideration of the benefit of
  wearing cloth&rdquo;(ii. 259). On the other hand, if cloth happened
  to rise in price, it at once commanded a sale among the wealthy, Wickham,
  in one of his letters, noticing the disposition of the Japanese, especially
  of the better sort, to buy those commodities which are most rare and
  when they are dearest. Spanish cloth, he says, never sold better than
  when it was high in price; when it fell, no one would look at it; when
  it again reached a high price, it recovered its reputation. Again,
  when warlike rumours were afloat there was a demand for cloth, as it
  was used for cases for arms; and so, we are told, the Japanese preferred
  good measure to fine quality. Sober colours were generally preferred.
  Venice red and flame colour would not sell at all in 1614. In 1620,
  blacks and reds are in fashion (ii. 311). Indian cloths sold not &ldquo;so
  much for necessity as for the new and strange fashions and paintings
  thereof&rdquo;, the Japanese
  &ldquo;being a people desiring change&rdquo; (ii. 273).</p>
<p>After Saris&rsquo;s departure, however, the English factory lost no time in
  attempting to establish trade in the country. At the beginning of the
  new year Wickham was sent as agent to Yedo; Eaton was stationed at
  Ozaka; and Sayers had a commission to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span> the northern parts of Kiushiu and the neighbouring
  island of Tsushima, the first step to trade with Corea. In Cocks&rsquo;s
  letters to Wickham we see the anxiety caused by the competition of
  the Dutch. Wickham was to &ldquo;sell away, although something under
  cento per cento,&rdquo; and not to be outstripped by his rivals.</p>
<p>A junk was also fitted out with a cargo worth
  ¬£750 to trade to Cochinchina, Tempest Peacock going in her as merchant
  (18th March, 1614) with Walter Carwarden to assist him. This venture
  was unfortunate. Peacock was killed in Cochinchina, treacherously as
  it appeared, and Carwarden was cast away on the return voyage. Although
  two attempts were subsequently made by Adams to renew intercourse,
  neither succeeded. Trade with Siam was also opened, a junk being at
  once bought and commissioned for the purpose. Adams showed skill and
  energy in fitting her for her voyage, and took the command in her first
  trip, which however failed, owing principally to the mutinous conduct
  of the crew. This venture was estimated at ¬£1,400.</p>
<p>But the country with which the English most coveted commercial relations
  was China; and through all the diary and correspondence of Cocks negotiations
  are always in progress. The two Chinese traders, Andrea Dittis, the
  landlord of the English house mentioned above, and his brother Whaw
  or Whow, who was stationed at Nagasaki, were the agents through whom
  Cocks hoped to obtain a footing in China, where also a third brother
  was supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span> to be negotiating with the authorities to obtain the
  desired privileges; and not inconsiderable sums were advanced to smooth
  the way. But China was then in a state of war and confusion, and although
  in the end, after years of waiting, Cocks was told that permission
  for trade was granted, no charter or other documents arrived, and,
  in any case, it was then, at the moment when the English were preparing
  to withdraw from Japan, too late to do anything.</p>
<p>The English factory, then, had been established about two years in June,
  1615, the date at which Cocks&rsquo;s diary begins. The house which had been
  hired of the China captain had been purchased and improved at a cost
  of nearly ¬£600. Foyne Sama had been dead some twelve months, and Figen
  a Sama reigned in his stead. Captain Brower had disappeared from the
  Dutch factory to make room for Jacob Speck. And we are at once carried
  into the midst of native affairs. On the 2nd of June reports reached
  Firando of the total defeat of the young prince Hid√©yori (Fidaia Sama)
  by Iy√©yasu. As we have already seen, Hid√©yori had been left in comparative
  freedom after the battle of S√©kigahara. He had now grown to man&rsquo;s estate,
  and had the sympathy of a large part of the country; and Cocks especially
  notices that the people of the southern parts &ldquo;affect the young
  man more than the old.&rdquo;
  Round him gathered all who had reason to fear or dislike his rival;
  and, when the final rupture took place, he had a following of 120,000
  men. There can be little doubt that the young prince perished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span> in the burning castle of Ozaka after the total defeat
  of his troops; but the fact that his body could not be found was enough
  to give rise to the rumour that he had escaped. His followers were
  hunted down and destroyed; but that he still lived was widely believed,
  and that belief lasted for years and is frequently noticed in these
  pages. Apollinario Franco, a Franciscan, who was present at the terrible
  scene at Ozaka, escaped to Firando and is mentioned early in the diary.
  Notwithstanding his protestant dislike of priests and friars, Cocks
  could not refuse Christian charity to one in such sore distress. We
  meet with him once or twice again. He died at the stake in Omura in
  1622. After the destruction of Ozaka the shoguns adopted the policy
  of detaining for stated periods, at court, the daimios of the several
  provinces or some members of their families. This arrangement is often
  noticed by Cocks.</p>
<p>At the end of August arrived the ship <i>Oziander</i> (or <i>Hozeander</i>)
  from England, and Captain Ralph Coppindall was sent up to court with
  the customary present. In a letter written after his return to Firando
  he records the unprofitable nature of the trade of Japan: &ldquo;either
  we must procure a peaceable trade in China, or else, as the Hollanders
  do, to trade with them perforce. And if we set foot in the Moluccas,
  this place will be a fit storehouse from whence we may always have
  men, munition, and victuals good store, and at reasonable rates&rdquo; (ii.
  271). These, indeed, were also the sentiments of the factors, and were
  repeated more than once.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>
<p>A quarrel with the Portuguese and Spaniards at Nagasaki, who had seized
  and imprisoned two of their own countrymen for serving the English,
  is among the events of this year. And, however much they might disagree
  among themselves, English and Dutch were at one when attacking or attacked
  by the other two rival nations; so that the capture of a Portuguese
  junk by the Dutch and her condemnation through Adams&rsquo;s influence at
  court as good prize gave unmixed satisfaction at Firando. In connection
  with this capture, an interesting conversation between Iy√©yasu and
  Adams is recorded (ii. 276).</p>
<p>Early in 1616 a report began to circulate that Iy√©yasu was dead. Cocks,
  with the caution with which he had learned to regard all Japanese news,
  rather viewed it as &ldquo;a fable given out of purpose to see how people
  would take the matter&rdquo;; and he, no doubt, only expresses the general
  feeling when he adds &ldquo;once the old man is subtil&rdquo;. In June
  the king of Firando is reported to have visited him,
  &ldquo;but was only permitted to enter into his chamber, where they
  say he lay sick in a little cabin covered with paper&rdquo;; and soon
  after it was known that he had really expired,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> not
  however before he had had the satisfaction of having his physician
  cut in pieces. Cocks, however, was hard of belief, and was convinced
  that &ldquo;he will soon rise again, if any wars be moved against his
  son within these three years.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span> This son was the shogun Hid√©tada, a man very different
  from his father in his manner of regarding foreigners.</p>
<p>It was now necessary for the English to send up a deputation to court
  for a confirmation of privileges under the new reign; and the ships <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Advice</i> arriving
  from England just at the time, Cocks got ready his presents and started
  at the end of July, in company with Adams who had just returned from
  Siam. The account of the journey to Yedo and of the audience with the
  shogun is very interesting. But they did not obtain what they sought.
  The privileges were curtailed and the English were restricted to the
  single port of Firando. In vain did Cocks petition to have this decision
  reversed; and, although the shogun&rsquo;s secretaries, Codskin Dono and
  Oyen Dono, did not seem to be unfavourable, they declared that it was
  impossible to alter matters. Inga Dono, also, the chief justice, could
  only tell Cocks &ldquo;that at present all matters were in other manner
  in Japan than in time of the old Emperor&rdquo;; and common report declared
  that
  &ldquo;no man dare speak to the Emperor of any matter they think is
  to his discontent, he is so furious, and no means but death and destruction&rdquo; (i.
  186, 187). In the end the English had to withdraw all their factors
  from Yedo, Miako, Sackay, and Ozaka.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
But it was not only in this particular that things were changed. Hid√©tada
  had determined to suppress Christianity. Since the first arrival of
  the Portuguese Jesuits, followed by the rapid conversion of whole districts
  in the western and southern parts of Japan, there had been no systematic
  attempt to stifle the new religion. The story told of Nobunaga, that,
  when he was urged to expel the Roman Catholic missionaries, he remarked
  that, as there were already thirty-five religious sects in Japan, a
  thirty-sixth could not make much difference,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> reflects
  the ease with which Christianity made its way in the country; and the
  same ruler&rsquo;s policy of tolerating the new tenets, while persecuting
  the Buddhist faith, gave them time to take root and flourish. A sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span> edict of Taiko Sama, expelling the Jesuits from the
  kingdom, was not enforced to the utmost; and Iy√©yasu generally left
  them in peace, although towards the end of his reign fresh edicts of
  banishment were issued and the sentence to a considerable extent carried
  into effect. But many priests still lurked in the country; and Cocks
  notices that the hostility shown to some of his men by the natives
  of Omura was &ldquo;by means of the padres, or priests, who stirred
  them up against us to make us odious to the Japons, for they are all,
  or the most part, papistical Christians in Umbra, and attribute a great
  or chief occasion of banishment of them out of Japon by means of the
  English, many papists and Jesuits lying secretly lurking in most parts
  of Japon till this hour&rdquo; (i. 139).<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> While
  Cocks was waiting in Yedo for the copy of the privileges he tells us
  that the Council sent &ldquo;above twenty times&rdquo; to question him
  about the religion of the English, and were hardly persuaded that Protestants
  were distinct from Roman Catholics. Even Adams, at whose house some
  Spaniards were staying, was suspected of harbouring priests and received
  warning. These things indicated, as the secretary Oyen Dono admitted,
  that the new ruler meant indeed to &ldquo;utterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span> extinguish&rdquo; the Jesuits and friars out of Japan;
  and there was good reason to believe that Christians of all sects would
  soon go the same way. The immediate result of this severity is seen
  soon after in the announcement, on the 22nd of May of the next year,
  of the execution of a Franciscan and a Jesuit;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and
  other persecutions followed afterwards.</p>
<p>Before Cocks returned to Firando, he visited William Adams&rsquo;s estate at
  Phebe (H√©mi)<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which
  had been bestowed on him by Iy√©yasu. &ldquo;There is&rdquo;, he says,
  describing it, &ldquo;above one hundred farms or households upon it,
  besides others under them, all which are his vassals, and he hath power
  of life and death over them, they being his slaves, and he has absolute
  authority over them as any tono or king in Japon hath over his vassals.&rdquo; (i.
  181.)</p>
<p>On their way back to Firando, they passed the site of Yoritomo&rsquo;s city
  of Kamakura, &ldquo;but now at present it is no city, but scattered
  houses seated here and there in pleasant valleys betwixt divers mountains,
  wherein are divers pagods very sumptuous, and a nunnery of shaven women.
  I did never see such pleasant walks among pine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span> spruce trees as there are about these pagods.&rdquo;
  This is the one place in all Japan whose natural beauty seems to have
  impressed even the matter-of-fact Cocks, who could dismiss the Hakon√© Pass
  with its fine lake and scenery in the one sentence,
  &ldquo;Haconey on the top of the mountain, where the great pond with
  the devil is, as they report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The altered state of feelings at Yedo began soon to be reflected at Firando.
  At the beginning of the new year the king showed a disposition to meddle
  in the affairs of the English trade and betrayed ill-humour in several
  small matters; and soon there were rumours that both English and Dutch
  would have to shift to other quarters. These disagreements drew a formal
  remonstrance from Cocks, who, &ldquo;entering into consideration of
  the small respect this king of Firando hath of us in comparison of
  that which he had at our first entrance into Japon&rdquo;, expressed
  his discontent in a &ldquo;large letter&rdquo;; which, however, was received &ldquo;in
  good part&rdquo;, and a friendly message returned. But, after this,
  things never went quite so smoothly as before.</p>
<p>Other troubles also began to close in on the English. Their relations
  with the Dutch were gradually becoming more and more estranged, until
  their differences culminated in open rupture. In 1617 rumours reached
  Firando of Dutch outrages on the English in Puloway, which tended to
  increase the coolness so rapidly growing between the members of the
  English and Dutch factories, who, as the Japanese observed, were friends, &ldquo;but
  from tooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span> outwards.&rdquo; The frequent piracies of the Dutch
  upon the Chinese are reflected on by Cocks, who also accuses them of
  gross cruelty to their prisoners. An aggravation of these crimes was
  the fact that they were committed, if not under the English flag, at
  least under the English name, the Dutch giving out that they were English.
  Their success in this form of deception is illustrated by an entry
  in the diary: &ldquo;These Chinas in the junk [just captured] will not
  be persuaded but that they are Englishmen which took them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It
  was, then, with only an outward show of friendship that the two nations
  carried on their trade in Firando.</p>
<p>In August of this year the <i>Advice</i> arrived from Bantam, and about
  the same time Adams returned from a voyage to Cochinchina. Another
  journey to court immediately followed; and this time no farther than
  Fushimi, near Miako, whither the shogun had come to visit the mikado.
  A renewed attempt, however, on the part of Cocks, to obtain an extension
  of the privileges, the principal object
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span> of the journey, failed altogether. At first, indeed,
  the right to trade in Nagasaki was added; but, in an evil hour, one
  of the councillors took exception, and this concession was cancelled.
  An answer was refused to a letter of James I., which was now presented,
  on the ground that it was addressed to the dead shogun Iy√©yasu and
  that it was held &ldquo;ominous amongst the Japans to answer to dead
  men&rsquo;s letters.&rdquo; In the end, poor Cocks was, as he said, put to &ldquo;Hodgson&rsquo;s
  choice&rdquo;, and had to take what privileges he could, or none at
  all. &ldquo;So we got out our goshons, but the privileges as they were
  the last year. Worry! worry! worry!&rdquo; In fact, the Japanese themselves
  saw the advantages to be derived from trade, and the shogun very naturally
  &ldquo;would have his own vassals to get the benefit to bring up merchandise
  rather than strangers.&rdquo; The result was that a company of native
  merchants appeared in the market and formed, if we may judge by Cocks&rsquo;s
  account of them, what would now be called a ring.</p>
<p>It was on the occasion of this visit to court that Cocks and his fellow-travellers
  came in contact with a Corean embassy, to which he refers several times.
  The object of their mission, we are told, was to pay a visit of ceremony
  to the sepulchre of Iy√©yasu, and to congratulate the new shogun upon
  his peaceful succession.</p>
<p>Nothing eventful occurred at the factory in the early part of 1618. During
  a visit to Nagasaki in February and March, Cocks makes several interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span> references to the Christians whom he met among the
  natives; and on his arrival at this half-Christianised town, the Chinese
  junks, which were dressed with flags in his honour, flew the cross
  of St. George among the rest. Before Foyne&rsquo;s death at Firando, the
  English had been compelled to haul down their flag on account of the
  Christian symbol that it bore. Meanwhile, however, on the north of
  Kiushiu bloody persecutions were being carried on; and a little later
  is recorded the news of the crucifixion of some thirty-seven men and
  women in Kokura. Disquieting rumours were also afloat of a confederacy
  of the southern daimios against the shogun.</p>
<p>Soon, however, occurred an event which concerned the English more nearly
  than the political state of Japan. On the 8th of August, to their intense
  indignation, a Dutch ship arrived at Firando bringing in, as prize,
  the English ship <i>Attendance</i>, which had been captured in the
  Moluccas. To do him justice, the Dutch factor Speck seems to have regretted
  the action and offered to restore her, but not, as Cocks remarks, before
  there had been time to empty her. An immediate journey to court naturally
  followed, in order to put in a written protest against this proceeding
  of the Dutch. But Cocks was told &ldquo;that for facts committed in
  other places the emperor would not meddle with it&rdquo;, so that, but
  for the easing of his conscience afforded by the delivery of his protest,
  and the pleasure of some sight-seeing, he might as well have remained
  at Firando.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
For nearly the whole of the year 1619 and 1620 the diary is wanting; and
  during the early part of this period the Dutch were masters of the
  sea, and the English in Japan were completely isolated. But, in order
  to maintain their interests in the East, the English Company had already,
  in 1617, despatched a fleet of five ships under command of Captain
  Martin Pring. He reached Bantam in the middle of 1618, and, sailing
  thence to Jacatra, had news of the Dutch attack on the English in the
  Moluccas. He was soon after joined at Bantam by a reinforcement of
  six large ships under Sir Thomas Dale, who assumed the command of the
  combined fleet. After some skirmishing, the English retired to India
  to refit; and there Dale died. Pring then again sailed eastward; but,
  finding himself outnumbered by the Dutch, he was on the point, early
  in 1620, of dividing his forces and himself sailing for Japan, when
  he received news of the union of the English and Dutch Companies. Thus
  relieved from fear of attack, he proceeded on his voyage and reached
  Firando in safety.</p>
<p>How the English fared in Firando during these two years we learn from
  Cocks&rsquo;s letters to the Company.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In
  the determined attack which the Dutch made on the English factory there
  can be little doubt that, had not the Japanese protected them, our
  countrymen would have fallen victims to the Hollanders, who, &ldquo;by
  sound of trumpet aboard all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span> their ships in the harbour of Firando, proclaimed
  open wars against our English nation, both by sea and land, with fire
  and sword, to take our ships and goods and destroy our persons to the
  uttermost of their power, as to their mortal enemies.&rdquo; But in
  the midst of these troubles there was a gleam of light in trade prospects,
  for the shogun was at last induced, early in 1620, to allow Nagasaki
  to be included in the English privileges. The advantages of that port,
  with its fine harbour, over the poor
  &ldquo;fisher town&rdquo; of Firando, with its bad anchorage, are duly
  set forth by Cocks; and we learn, at the same time, the reasons why
  the larger town was not selected at first, &ldquo;which heretofore was
  not thought fit, because then a papist Portingale bishop lived in the
  town, and there was ten or twelve parish churches, besides monasteries.&rdquo; But
  now all was changed; churches and monasteries had been levelled with
  the earth, and even graveyards uprooted and &ldquo;all the dead men&rsquo;s
  bones taken out of the ground and cast forth.&rdquo; The news of the
  union of the two companies will account for the English still remaining
  in their old quarters in Firando, to keep near the Dutch, instead of
  migrating to Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Death had also in this interval brought misfortunes to the English factory.
  The first loss was that of Whaw, the Chinaman, upon whom Cocks so much
  relied to obtain privileges for the China trade. Then Nealson died
  in March, 1620. And, last of all,
  &ldquo;our good friend Captain William Adams, who was so long before
  us in Japon, departed out of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span> world the 16th of May last.&rdquo; If for no other
  reason, we must on Adams&rsquo;s account deplore the loss of Cocks&rsquo;s diary
  for this period, which would undoubtedly have contained some details
  of his last illness and death. It is also to be regretted that we do
  not find more personal details about Adams in the portions of the diary
  which have survived; but he was so often absent on trading voyages
  and other business that Cocks must be excused if he tells us no more
  than he does. As already noticed, the cape-merchant held him in some
  awe, and, if we may believe the diary, Adams was inclined to be somewhat
  hasty in temper. On the other hand, he did the Company good and faithful
  service, and, to judge by small things, the reader will not fail to
  notice the patience with which he waited, time after time, on the dilatory
  pleasure of court officials, in the interest of the English. His influence
  with the shoguns is more than once referred to. &ldquo;The Emperor [Iy√©yasu],&rdquo; writes
  Cocks in 1616, &ldquo;esteemeth him much, and he may go and speak with
  him at all times, when kings and princes are kept out&rdquo;; and again,
  in 1620: &ldquo;I cannot but be sorrowful for the loss of such a man
  as Captain William Adams was, he having been in such favour with two
  Emperors of Japon as never was any Christian in these parts of the
  world, and might freely have entered and had speech with the Emperors,
  when many Japon kings stood without and could not be permitted.&rdquo; Adams
  had a wife and daughter living in England. He also had a son and daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span> in Japan.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> To
  all of these he left his property in equal shares. References are several
  times made to the disposal of his goods and to the transmission of
  money to England, as well as to difficulties arising from the disposition
  of certain goshons or trading licences belonging to his children in
  Japan.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span></p>
<p>The result in Japan of the union of the English and Dutch Companies was,
  as we have seen, that the English factory remained at Firando instead
  of removing to the far more commodious town of Nagasaki. A combined
  fleet of English and Dutch ships, sailing under the modest name of
  the Fleet of Defence, was equipped for the purpose of endamaging the
  common enemy and of diverting the trade of China from the Philippine
  Islands to the Dutch and English settlements; in other words, to blockade
  the Spanish and Portuguese ports and seize as many of the Chinese trading
  junks as possible. In the two expeditions to the Philippines undertaken
  by the fleet before the English and Dutch again separated, they captured
  many prizes; and the Dutch are said to have treated their Chinese prisoners
  with great cruelty, while their new allies interfered to protect these
  unfortunate people. All the time, however, that the English were thus
  engaged at sea, peaceful negotiations were still being carried on by
  Cocks for establishing trade with China, though it is not surprising
  that &ldquo;our joining with the Hollanders to take China junks is ill
  thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1621 the English at Firando, apparently with the idea that trade was
  now going to flourish, built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span> a new warehouse and wharves, and undertook other
  works on a large scale. But it was impossible that their relations
  with the Dutch could be cordial; and dissensions soon broke out. There
  was ill blood between the sailors of the two nations. In the Philippines
  they could scarcely be restrained from fighting; and when, at the end
  of June, the fleet returned to Firando and the crews got ashore, they
  at once came to blows, and a Dutchman was killed. Then followed the
  trial and execution of the English sailor who had killed him; and the
  temper in which his shipmates regarded his condemnation may be judged
  from the fact that &ldquo;Captain Robert Adams was forced to put the
  rope about his neck with his own hands.&rdquo; And it was not only with
  the English that the Dutch sailors quarrelled. They were drunken and
  riotous and &ldquo;brabbled&rdquo; in the streets, till at last the long-suffering
  Japanese lost patience and seizing two of them summarily cut off their
  heads. The English, too, demanded a victim. A Dutchman, who had stabbed
  an Englishman, was condemned and executed by his own countrymen in
  a novel fashion, &ldquo;they having first made the man so drunk that
  he could scarce stand on his legs, and so cut off his head within their
  own house.&rdquo; As to the crews of the English shipping, they were
  perhaps only a degree less turbulent; to maintain discipline and set
  an example, four runaways were condemned and hanged.</p>
<p>In 1620 the English ship, <i>Elizabeth</i>, cruising off the Island of
  Formosa, captured a Japanese vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span> on her way from the Philippines to Japan. On board
  were found two priests, who, in the end, proved to be Pedro de Zu√±iga,
  an Augustinian, and Luis Flores, a Dominican. They long denied their
  names; and we find many references in the diary to their examination
  at Firando. (It was an object to the English and Dutch to convict them,
  as, in such case, the ship became good prize.) In the end, these two
  unfortunate men, together with the Japanese captain of the vessel,
  were, in 1622, put to death by the horrible torture of slow fire, and
  the crew were beheaded;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> so
  that we cannot much regret that the captors were baulked of their prize.
  With grim humour the shogun appropriated the cargo for himself, &ldquo;leaving
  the rotten hull for us and the Hollanders.&rdquo; So, much against their
  will, the factors had to deliver over the prize goods, after a little
  hesitation, which, however, they saw it was useless to persist in,
  when Cocks was told that &ldquo;they would take it whether we would
  or no, and that, if we had not absolutely proved the Portingalls to
  be padres, the Emperor meant to have put Captain Leonard Camps and
  me to death and to have seized on all we had in the country; and, if
  any resistance had been made, to have burned all our shipping and put
  us all to the sword&rdquo; (ii. 335).</p>
<p>At the end of 1621 Cocks set out on the last visit to the court at Yedo
  recorded in his diary, the English and their Dutch allies now going
  in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span> company. Speck was no longer at the head of the
  Dutch factory. He had left Japan in the previous October; his successor
  being Leonard Camps, who was now Cocks&rsquo;s travelling companion. After
  delivering the customary presents, and after the usual long delay in
  getting leave to depart, they were dismissed without the shogun&rsquo;s return
  gifts, which were not ready, &ldquo;which truly is the greatest wrong
  or indignity that ever hitherto was offered to any Christians.&rdquo; It
  is almost unnecessary to add that Cocks and Camps quarrelled. The diary
  ends on the 24th of March, 1622, in the middle of the journey back
  to Firando; and in the last entry Cocks tells us how the Hollanders
  slipped away from him. No phrase could better express the whole course
  of the dealings of the Dutch with the English in Japan.</p>
<p>The rest of the story of the English factory is soon told. The Council
  of Defence of the East India Company at Batavia had some time before
  determined to reduce it to small dimensions. In his letter of the 7th
  September, 1622, Cocks records the receipt of orders &ldquo;to leave
  off our consortship of the Fleet of Defence with the Hollanders, and
  to send our five ships for Jaccatra with as much speed as conveniently
  we could&rdquo;; all money and merchandise was to be withdrawn, except
  a small
  &ldquo;cargezon&rdquo; or stock worth 5,000 taels, to be left in charge
  of Osterwick and a couple of assistants; and Cocks, Eaton, and Sayers
  were to &ldquo;come along in the said ships for Jaccatra, for lessening
  charges in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span> the factory.&rdquo; All which directions the cape-merchant
  piously assured the Company should be followed
  &ldquo;as near as we can&rdquo;; but nevertheless stayed where he was.
  The difficulty, however, of getting payment of outstanding debts was
  at least some excuse; and he still fondly clung to the hopes of the
  China trade.</p>
<p>While the English were thus yielding ground, their Dutch rivals were more
  energetic than ever. They had failed in an attempt to surprise Macao;
  but had forcibly established themselves in the Pescadore Islands, and
  they still persisted in their old offence of passing for Englishmen.
  It was only a few months later that the Amboyna massacre was perpetrated.</p>
<p>At last, at a consultation of the Council at Batavia on the 25th of April,
  1623, the dissolution of the English factory in Japan was formally
  decided. Captain Joseph Cockram was despatched in the ship <i>Bull</i>,
  invested with full powers. It was, however, left to his discretion
  to allow two juniors to remain to collect debts, if there were any
  prospect of recovery. He arrived at Firando in July, bearing a letter,
  dated 22nd May, from the Council, directing all the members of the
  factory &ldquo;to come away from thence upon the ship <i>Bull</i> for
  Batavia; hereby charging you and every of you to fulfil our said order,
  as you will answer the contrary at your perils.&rdquo; Cocks is ordered
  to get in all the debts he can; and he is blamed in severe terms for
  the loss of the &ldquo;great sums&rdquo; which he had advanced for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span> China trade: &ldquo;The China Nocheda<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> hath
  too long deluded you, through your own simplicity, to give credit unto
  him. You have lived long enough in those parts to be better experienced
  of the fraudulent practices of those people.&rdquo; The English buildings
  at Firando are to be handed over to the king, to hold in trust &ldquo;until
  such time as we shall send thither again to repossess the same.&rdquo; And
  so, after some other orders, the letter concludes with a caustic admonition
  that, &ldquo;because last year, to serve your own turn, you made what
  construction you pleased of our commission for your coming from thence,
  we do now iterate our commission in the conclusion of our letter, lest,
  having read it in the former part thereof, you should forget it before
  you come to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preparations for departure were at once made; the ostensible reasons given
  to the king of Firando being the loss of ships and the bad prospects
  of the China trade, and not &ldquo;out of any unkind usage here in his
  Majesty&rsquo;s [the shogun&rsquo;s] dominions.&rdquo;
  But, anxious as they now were to shake themselves free of Japan, the
  factors were still obliged to send up one of their number, Richard
  Hudson, to deliver the customary present to the shogun; so that it
  was not till nearly the end of the year that they were ready to quit
  Firando.</p>
<p>On the 16th of December, in consultation, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
determined to leave no one behind to collect
  debts; but the Dutch factor was empowered to receive any
  sums that might come in. The amount owing to the factory
  was 12,821 taels, about ¬£3,200, out of which Dittis was
  answerable for 6,636 taels, or
  ¬£1,659. The following abstract<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> of
  a lost portion of Cocks&rsquo;s diary gives us particulars of the last days
  spent by the English in Japan:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Abstract</i> &ldquo;<i>Coppie of some passages at our leaving
    Jappan and dissolving ye English Factory at Ferando in
    ye yeare 1623. Taken out of</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.
    Richard Cock</span> <i>his Journall; who was Chiefe these
    eleven or 12 yeares.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>December 19.</i>&mdash;Tonomon Sarume paid 100 <i>Tale</i> on
    account of his debt of 500 <i>Tales</i>.</p>
  <p><i>December 20.</i>&mdash;Prepared in the Japanese language the
    accounts of the noblemen indebted to the factory, in order that
    the parties might sign them as an acknowledgment of the debt
    to be left with the Dutch chief for recovery; a power of attorney
    for that purpose, also in Japanese, being signed by all the factors
    and delivered to him. Copies of these several writings were also
    prepared for the king.</p>
  <p>On the 22nd these writings were delivered to the Dutch chief, Capt.
    Newrode; and the copies sent to the king. The factors &ldquo;had
    much adoe with Tonomon Sama, Semidono, Taccamondono, and others,
    to give us their bills ... and, when they didd itt, put in what
    they list.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the 21st and 22nd sundry small presents in money were given to
    the Japanese servants and others, few exceeding two or three <i>Tale</i>.</p>
  <p>On the 22nd many of the townsmen came with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span> wives and families to take leave
    of the factors, some weeping at their departure.</p>
  <p>On the 23rd the factors went on board the ship <i>Bull</i>, intending
    to set sail; but, the Dutch and many of their Japanese friends
    coming on board with banquets, they postponed their departure;
    and, there not being room in the ship to serve up the presents
    of their friends, more than one hundred being on board, they
    landed at Cochi. Afterwards Messrs. Cock and Osterwicke proposed,
    as a return to their friends, to leave 50 <i>Tales</i> as a banquet
    for them all; but the other factors would not agree to it.</p>
  <p>On the 24th, at noon, they set sail for Batavia. The same night
    in a storm the <i>Bull</i> sprung a leak, and was found to make
    six inches of water every half-hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Bull</i> reached Batavia on the 27th of January, 1624. And now
  poor Cocks was indeed in trouble. In their letter of the 24th February
  to the East India Company the Council of Defence accuse him of culpable
  carelessness; that he neither kept the accounts himself nor appointed
  others to do so; that he disobeyed orders in not leaving Japan the
  year before; that he made a desperate debt of 5,000 taels with the
  China captain; and that he had brought a store of trash and lumber
  from Japan. No consultations had been kept, nor decorum nor order observed.
  They were tempted to deal severely with him and send him home as a
  malefactor; but, having consideration for his age and position, and
  allowing for his bad health and testy and wayward disposition, and
  being also persuaded that harsh treatment might shorten his life, they
  left him to be dealt with by the Company, only ordering his goods to
  be seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
on his arrival in England.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Thus,
  in disgrace and broken in health, Cocks went on board the <i>Ann Royal</i>,
  and on the 24th of February sailed for England. But he was not to see
  his country again. A month later, on the 27th of March, he died at
  sea, and was buried &ldquo;under a discharge of ordnance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt many of the charges brought against Cocks were true. Traces of
  confusion in his money accounts are to be found in his diary; and he
  was too easy-going for the position of head of a factory which had
  so many obstacles in the way of its development. There can be no question
  of his want of firmness. His many quarrels with companions and subordinates,
  and the somewhat helpless way in which he records them, afford sufficient
  indications of this failing. But he was perfectly honest; he died poor;
  and his very weaknesses render him a not unamusing diarist. This last
  qualification makes us his friend; and we cannot accompany him through
  these pages without feeling good will towards him. We note his quaint
  phrases; his sharp eye for &ldquo;trix&rdquo;
  and &ldquo;legerdemayne&rdquo; of enemies, or for the &ldquo;playing the
  gemeny&rdquo; of doubtful friends; how this man is angry and &ldquo;takes
  pepper in the nose&rdquo;, while another loses temper and takes a proposal &ldquo;in
  snuff&rdquo;, and a third in a rage &ldquo;falls into terms&rdquo;; and
  we see him reduced to &ldquo;Hodgson&rsquo;s choice&rdquo; long before he ought
  to be, if Cambridge Hobson gave his name to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span> proverb.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> He
  had a taste for planting and gardening; he grew the first potatoes
  in Japan; &ldquo;forget not my pigeons and fishes&rdquo; is an injunction
  in one of his letters, when away from home; his gold fish, presents
  from China, were dearly prized and not willingly given away to the
  great men in Firando who coveted them&mdash;all these are pleasant
  traits. Nor was he, though &ldquo;unlettered&rdquo; and a little unsteady
  when he quoted Latin, without some taste for books. He had a <i>Turkish
  History</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and
  a <i>St. Augustyn Citty of God</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to
  lend a friend (i. 118); and he received a present of an English book
  of <i>Essaies</i> (i. 230). But we need not assume that he had read
  Chaucer because he calls a long rambling statement a Canterbury Tale
  (i. 282).</p>
<p>His property was only worth 1,500 reals, about
  ¬£300; but, in accordance with the advice of the Council of Defence
  quoted above, it was seized on the arrival of the <i>Ann Royal</i> in
  England. We learn from the minutes of the East India Company that a
  petition was afterwards presented respecting Cocks&rsquo;s small estate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>24th Nov. 1626.</i>&mdash;Mr. Cox, brother unto Capt. Cox
    that dyed homewarde bound in the <i>Anne</i>, presented himselfe
    in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span> Court, and desired by peticion the favor of the
    Comp. concerning his brother&rsquo;s estate, to whom the Court related
    the debaust carriage of his brother and the evill service performed
    by him at Japan, where he had lived long contrarie to the Companies
    mind and had expended 40,000 pounds, never returning anything
    to the Comp. but consuming whatsoever came to his hands in wastfull
    unnecessarie expences; nay, for 3 yeares togeather refused to
    come away when by expresse order from the Comp. he was called
    thence; insoemuch that at last the President and Councell [of
    Batavia] were inforced to send for him with a ship sent purposelie.
    And for his estate he had at the time of his death, the Court
    told him, it was very little or none at all, and, if any, yett
    not sufficient to answer the Comp. what he ought them, haveing
    confessed upon foote of his accompt at Jaccatra that he was indebted
    to the Companie ¬£900.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Cox was sorry to heare this report of his brother and
    desired the Court to deale favorably with him. In the end the
    Court wished him to informe himself concerning the truth of these
    things from those that are come home; and, because the Comp.
    at presente have no leisure to examine his proceedings, they
    therefore willed Mr. Cox to returne home and leave the buisnes
    to Mr. Woodward to effect yt one his behalfe.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, the money was paid over by the Company to Cocks&rsquo;s relatives.</p>
<p>Scarcely anything was ever recovered from the debts owing to the Company
  in Japan. The Council at Batavia, writing home on the 6th February,
  1626, announce that the Dutch factor at Firando had informed them of
  the death of the Chinaman, Andrea Dittis, who had left only a small
  estate to satisfy his creditors, out of which the Company was to receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span> its share. All other debts were bad, and no return
  was to be expected but by mere accident.</p>
<p>Thus was severed our connection with Japan, not to be re-united until
  our own day. But the re-occupation of our factory was often proposed
  and more than once attempted. Even when writing their letter just referred
  to, the Council at Batavia spoke of it. Again in 1627 they proposed
  it. In 1633 a freeman of the Company, named Smithwick, again raised
  the question; and again in 1635 it was debated. In 1658 the Company
  actually fitted three ships to re-open the trade, but the lateness
  of the season and the prospect of a Dutch war caused them to abandon
  the expedition. In 1664 the Company again seriously thought of the
  undertaking and wrote to Bantam for information respecting the late
  settlement at Firando; and it is remarkable that so soon after our
  retirement so little was remembered. The reply was that &ldquo;in this
  factory here is not the least remembrance of your servants acting in
  Japan formerly; only your agent hath procured a jornall of a voyage
  made thither in 1615; but it mentions only the acting of the mariner,
  nothing of the factor.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In
  1668 a committee was appointed to consider how trade could be re-opened,
  and in the next year enquiries were again addressed to Bantam. From
  thence was announced a rumour that the Dutch had tried to purchase
  the English buildings at Firando, but were refused by the daimio, who
  was in expectation of our return! In 1670 the ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span> <i>Advance</i> was sent out to Bantam, to be used
  in reopening trade, if thought convenient; but she was despatched to
  Persia. But in 1671 two ships, the <i>Crown</i> and <i>Bantam</i>,
  were actually commissioned to make a voyage from Bantam to Taiwan and
  thence to Nagasaki; the supercargoes receiving instructions to find
  out where the English formerly resided at Firando and why they were
  removed. These vessels were lost. The same year the agent at Bantam
  reported that &ldquo;there are some Scotch, Irish, etc., there [at Firando],
  although wee know not by what occasion there&rdquo;, an interesting
  remark, probably referring to descendants of the old settlers. At last
  the matter was seriously taken in hand, and ships were despatched from
  England in 1672 with a letter from Charles II to the emperor of Japan,
  every care being taken to escape the attention of the Dutch. Those
  wary traders, however, did not fail to discover the English designs;
  so that, when at length the ship <i>Return</i> arrived at Nagasaki
  on the 29th of June, 1673, it was found that her coming was expected.
  The crew were well treated and allowed provisions while a message was
  despatched to the shogun; but the new-comers were closely watched and
  sharply questioned about their religion. Again, as in Cocks&rsquo;s days,
  the cross of St. George in the English flag gave trouble. It is interesting
  to find it noticed that one of his old interpreters was still living.
  At last, on the 28th of July, the shogun&rsquo;s decision was announced.
  The Dutch had taken care to inform the Japanese of Charles&rsquo;s marriage
  with a princess of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span> the Roman Catholic family of Portugal; and the shogun
  refused to accept the friendship of one who had allied himself with
  a daughter of the enemies of Japan. So the <i>Return</i> sailed away
  on the 28th of August; and, after this, only indirect attempts to open
  negotiations by the mediation of the princes of Bantam, Amoy, Taiwan,
  Tonquin, and Siam were made in 1681 and 1683.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>The social relations of the English with their Japanese neighbours were
  on the whole friendly. Periodical exchanges of presents and courtesies
  were the rule, although an occasional quarrel or street row was only
  to be expected where so many elements of turbulence were present in
  drunken sailors and factory-men. The domestic arrangements of the English
  are patent enough in the pages of the diary, and appear to have given
  no offence to the natives. Only on one occasion do we read of &ldquo;rhymes
  cast abroad and sung up and down&rdquo; against the native women at
  the English factory; which, moreover, Cocks attributed to the instigation
  of the Dutch, &ldquo;songs having been made against them to like effect
  before, but not against us.&rdquo; They were even allowed to hold slaves,
  although they were afterwards forbidden to export them. They also appear
  to have kept on good terms with the princes of the neighbouring provinces;
  the daimio of Satsuma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span> being specially noticed for his friendliness. The
  Dutch, on the other hand, were not so conciliatory; and we have seen
  that the natives of Firando sided with the English against them, when
  they attacked the English factory. But they were richer and could afford
  handsomer presents; and thus had always friends at court.</p>
<p>Many of the notices of native customs are interesting. The reader will
  at once remark several instances of the Japanese severity in punishing
  offences which our modern code regards as comparatively trivial. Death
  was the penalty for the most petty theft. Cocks tells us of a boy of
  sixteen who was cut in pieces with great cruelty for stealing a little
  boat and taking it to another island; and again, of a man who was &ldquo;roasted
  to death, running round about a post, fire being made about him&rdquo;,
  the offence being also theft of a &ldquo;small bark of little or no
  value&rdquo; (i. 291). A curious form of degradation is mentioned in
  connection with an execution on a certain occasion, when the brother
  of a criminal &ldquo;had the lock of his hair cut off by the hangman
  with the same cattan which cut his brother in pieces&rdquo; (i. 156).
  The difference in European and Japanese ideas of justice was well exemplified
  when the Dutch factor, complaining of an assault on one of his countrymen,
  demanded that
  &ldquo;the parties which offered the abuse might be brought to the place
  where they did it and be beaten with cudgels. At which the king smiled
  and said it could not be, but, if he would have them cut in pieces,
  he would do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
The custom of suicide of friends and retainers at the funeral of a great
  man is referred to more than once. Saris mentions the mint-master of
  Iy√©yasu as &ldquo;one that hath vowed that, whensoever the Emperor shall
  die, he will cut his own guts and die with him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> No
  doubt he was one of the two nobles who &ldquo;killed themselves to accompany
  Ogosho Sama in another world, as they think&rdquo;, and whose monument
  Cocks saw at Yedo in 1618. In his letter of 10th December, 1614, Cocks
  also reports that, at the death of old Foyne Sama, &ldquo;Ushian Dono,
  his governor, and two other servants, cut their bellies to bear him
  company&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and
  in the curious account of the funeral of Foyne&rsquo;s brother, in 1621,
  we are told that
  &ldquo;one bose or priest hanged himself in a tree hard by the place
  of funeral ... for boses may not cut their bellies, but hang themselves
  they may&rdquo;. Some of the dead man&rsquo;s servants too were only restrained
  from self-sacrifice by the king&rsquo;s orders; and &ldquo;many others, his
  friends, cut off the two foremost joints of their little fingers and
  threw them into the fire to be burned with the corpse&rdquo; (ii. 202).</p>
<p>The practice of hara-kiri, or self destruction to avoid disgrace, is mentioned
  as occurring at Firando on two occasions (i. 337; ii. 136).</p>
<p>A few other points of interest may be noticed. The spread of Christianity
  through the southern and western provinces has already been referred
  to. The mother of the king of Firando is called &ldquo;a papistical
  Jesuit, and he and the rest of his brethren and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span> sisters papistical Christians&rdquo; (ii. 250). Again,
  at the funeral of Foyne&rsquo;s brother, mentioned above, it was said that
  a log of wood was substituted for the real body and burned, &ldquo;for
  he was thought to be a Christian&rdquo; (ii. 201). On the other hand,
  it seems that the Japanese would not admit into their faith perverts
  from Christianity, for an Englishman &ldquo;went and cut his hair after
  the pagan fashion, thinking to turn pagan; which he could not do here,
  although he would&rdquo; (i. 179). The changing of names, which gives
  so much trouble in reading Japanese history, is often mentioned. Figen
  a Sama is at first called Tome Sama; and some of his relatives appear
  suddenly under new names in 1621 (ii. 169). The caboques, or dancing
  bears as Cocks calls them, that is, the dancing women or players, and
  their male companions, are present at every large entertainment mentioned
  in the diary. And, lastly, the readiness of the Japanese to adopt foreign
  customs is curiously exemplified in the rapidity with which tobacco-smoking
  spread among the people. &ldquo;It is strange&rdquo;, says Cocks, writing
  in 1615, &ldquo;to see how these Japons, men, women, and children, are
  besotted in drinking that herb; and not ten years since it was in use
  first.&rdquo; When once the habit had got such a hold, no measures for
  the destruction of the plant could change it. The &ldquo;drinking&rdquo; inevitably
  went on, and in 1619 the burning of half a town is ascribed to it.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>In conclusion I should mention that one of the chief difficulties with
  which I have had to contend in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span> editing these volumes has been that of finding explanations
  of the foreign words and terms in the diary. Cocks adopted words from
  other languages besides Japanese, and generally wrote them down as
  they sounded. Hence it was no easy matter for one ignorant of eastern
  languages to decide whether particular words, thus disguised, are Japanese
  or of some other tongue; and I fear that I have too often taxed the
  patience and good nature of my orientalist friends for solutions of
  these difficulties. It is with pleasure that I take this opportunity
  of thanking Dr. William Anderson, whose knowledge of the language of
  Japan is so extensive, and my colleagues Dr. Charles Rieu and Professor
  R. K. Douglas, for much valuable assistance. I also gratefully acknowledge
  kind help and many courtesies from Mr. Charles C. Prinsep, Superintendent
  of the Records, and Mr. Edward J. Wade, Assistant-Librarian, in the
  India office; and from Mr. W. Noel Sainsbury, of the Public Record
  Office.</p>

<h2>DIARY OF RICHARD COCKS.</h2>
<h3>THE JOURNALL OR DAILYE BOOK OF ALL ACCURRANTES HAPPENYNG,
  BEGUN AT FIRANDO, IN JAPON, PER ME RIC. COCKS, LE 1TH
  DAY OF JUNE, 1615, STILO VETRI.</h3>
<p><i>June 1.</i>&mdash;We bought 5 greate square postes of the kinges master
  carpenter; cost 2 <i>mas</i> 6 <i>condrins</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> per
  peece. And I delivered unto Nicholas Martyn one small bar gould, cost
  eight riall of eight<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and
  a half, is six <i>taies</i> eight <i>mas</i>, for which he is answerable.
  Also I delivered a great bar gold, poz. fowre <i>taies</i> and fowre <i>mas</i> and
  two <i>condrins</i>, rated at fiftie and five <i>taies</i> as yt cost;
  and is to send to Gapt. Whowe, the Capt. Chinas<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> brother,
  at Langasaque;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to
  geve in a present at a christning, as apereth per advice.</p>
<p>Also I paid, per Mr. Nealson, for washing linen, two <i>mas</i> 6 <i>condrins</i>.</p>
<p>And late within night Mr. Wickham arived here in company of Damian Marines,
  and brought word the junck was at Goto, they being put from Liquea<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to
  have proceaded on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> their voyage for Syam; but, being at sea, the unruly
  companie would have gon for Cochinchina, and so Mr. Wickham standing
  against it, remembring our former losse theare (as I gave hym in comition),
  they retorned back for these partes. Capt. Adames hath wrot me that
  the boateswaine and carpenter are in most falte, being mutenouse knaves,
  etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 2.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames and Ed. Sayer wrot me 2 letters from
  Goto of 30th May; and Mr. Adames sent me a bag of potatos, and Ed.
  Sayer sent me a pece lik lynen (or rather silk) and the lyke to Mr.
  Eaton and Mr. Nealson. And Mr. Wickham gave me a jar of potatos. And
  Damian Marines brought me a dish of plantians and another of pottatos,
  etc. I receved a letter from Jno. de Lievano, the Spaniard. And Mr.
  Wickham went and visited Bongo Dono,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and
  carid hym a present of 2 pec. Liquea cloth and a dish of pottatos;
  and tould hym how matters stood about our junck, and withall asked
  his counsell, whether it were best to let our junck stay at Goto to
  be trymbd, or else to bring her for Firando. And his opynion was (as
  many others are the lyke, and among the rest my selfe) that it is best
  to bring her for Firando, for divers occations.</p>
<p>We had news to day that Ogosho Samme hath taken the fortres of Osekey
  and overthrown the forses of Fidaia Samme.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Others
  say that most of the forses of Fidaia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> Samme issued out of the fortrese, and sallid out 3 leagues
  toward Miaco, but were encountred by the Emperours forses and put to
  the worse, many of them being slaughtered and the rest driven back
  into the fortresse, etc. Bongo Dono sent a bark this day to Crates<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to
  bring him the certenty of the newse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 3.</i>&mdash;I thought good to note downe that a padre or Jesuit
  came to the English howse and said his name was Tomas and a Bisken
  by nation, and gave it out he was a merchant; and others gave hym the
  name of Captain. Yet I knew what he was, having seen hym in this howse
  before, etc. He beged a littell alloes<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of
  me, which I gave hym, as I did the like when he was here before. For
  you must understand that these padres have all the gifte of beging,
  and allwais answer: &ldquo;Sea por l&rsquo;amor de dios.&rdquo; This is a generall
  note to know them by, for they cannot so counterfet but that word will
  still be thrust out. This padre, Tomas (or Capt.), tould me that they
  stood in dowbt that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> the King of Shashma<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> would
  destroy Langasaque and bring all these partes beloe Shiminaseque<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> under
  his subiection, as being geven him by Fidaia Samme; but I believe it
  not, for now word is com on a sudden that all the streets must be made
  cleane, for that the King of Shashma is expected to be heare this night,
  he being bound up with great forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 4.</i>&mdash;We bought 40 boardes at 5 per <i>mas</i>, small plate;
  and 4 <i>cacas</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> at
  12 <i>condrins</i> peece, small plate.</p>
<p>And about nowne we had news that the King of Shashma was coming into this
  road with 500 barks full of souldiers; soe we laid out a present for
  him as followeth:&mdash;</p>

<p> Soe, Mr. Wickham accompanying me, we went and delivered the present,
  which he took in good parte, offring our nation favorable entertaynment
  yf we came to traffick in his domynions. I put out a word how the Liqueans
  refuse to let us trym our junk to have proceaded from thence on our
  voyag for Syam;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> but
  he said littell thereto, but answered, at his retorne he wold talke
  with me and geve me a present. I said I had receved suffition at his
  highnes hands in havinge the good hap to see the face of soe mightie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> a king as the King of Shashma; whereat he smiled. And
  soe we craved lycence and retorned.</p>
<p>Bongo Dono was with hym before and gave hym a present, and came from hym
  as we went to hym; but we had byn with hym before hym, yf he had not
  sent a boate to call us back till he had first vizeted hym.</p>
<p>And at present a letter is com to Bongo Dono from Faccatay,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> wherin
  he is advized that the Emperour hath overthrowne the forses of Fidaia
  Samme, soe that he, his mother, and child have cut their bellies; but
  that his wife is sent back to her father Shongo Samme, King of Edo
  and to succeed in the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 5.</i>&mdash;There came letters from the King of Firando to Bongo
  Dono, that it is true that the Emperour hath overthrowne the forcese
  of Fidaia Samme, and taken the fortres of Osekey, and entred into it
  the 6th day of this moone, Fidaia Samme and his mother with his sonne
  having cut their bellies, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham went and visited Oyen Dono, and carid hym a dish of pottatos
  and a peec of Liquea cloth. His brother retorned from above, whilst
  Mr. Wickham was theare, and confermed these newes to be true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 6.</i>&mdash;I wrot an other letter to Jorge Durois to look out
  for a marchant to buy our wheate, as also of the confermyng the newes
  from above.</p>
<p>There was one of the King of Shashmas barkes cast away coming in, but
  all the men saved. We bought 1 <i>caca</i> or squar post, cost 1 <i>mas</i>.
  We delivered or sent to keep to Capt. China 51 bundelles great canes,
  in each are 30 canes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 7.</i>&mdash;After dyner came a Franciskan frire, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> Padre Appolonario, whom I had seene 2 or
  3 tymes in Firando heretofore. He was in the fortres of
  Osekey<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> when
  it was taken, and yet had the good happ to escape. He tould
  me he brought nothing away with hym but the clothes on
  his back, the action was soe sudden; and that he marvelled
  that a force of above 120,000 men (such as was that of
  Fidaia Samme) should be soe sowne overthrowne. He desired
  me for God&rsquo;s sake to geve hym somthing to eate, for that
  he had passed much misery in the space of 15 daies, since
  he departed out of the fortres of Osekey. So, after he
  had eaten, I gave hym 15 <i>mas</i> in plate; and soe he
  departed.</p>
<p>We had 1830 tiles this day for ston walles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;Yt is said the King of Shashma hath geven order to
  his people to retorne back for their cuntrey; I meane the most parte
  of them. The rest he keepeth to carry along with hym to goe vizet the
  Emperour.</p>
<p>We bought 4 <i>cacas</i>, cost 7 <i>condrins</i> per peec, small plate,
  etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;I sent to borow 4 or 5 <i>gantas</i><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> of
  oyle of Yasimon Dono, because I could get non in any other place. But
  he retorned answer he had non, when I know, to the contrary, he bought
  a parcell out of my handes the other day. And I wrot a letter to Jorge
  Durois to take heed he gave out no yll reportes of Safian Dono. The
  China Capt. lent us 6 great mesurs (or <i>gantas</i>) of oyle, to repay
  as much. And Semidones steward came in the abcense of his master to
  borow a bar of plate of 3 <i>taies</i> wight, which was lent hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 9.</i>&mdash;Late within night I receved a letter from Ed. Sayer,
  dated in the Roade of Casnora in the Island of Goto,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> the 7th currant, wherin he writ the junck wold com away
  for this towne of Firando by first wind. Jno. Japon brought this letter,
  but is sick of the French disease, and took up his lodging at an other
  howse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 10.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Jorge Durois, dated the
  17th of June, new stile, in Langasaque, with a baskit of aprecockes
  for my selfe, and an other for Bongo Dono, and a therd for his wife,
  with a parcell in a bag for the China Capten; all which were delivered
  according to advice.</p>
<p>A Spaniard called Pablo Garrocho de la Vega came to this towne of Firando
  to-day and brought Jorges letter.</p>
<p>And before nowne word came that our junck was seene without. Soe I made
  ready to boate to goe out to Cochi to see them put in harbor, and to
  vizet Capt. Adames, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 11.</i>&mdash;Our juncke, the <i>Sea Adventure</i>, arived in
  the Bay of Cochi in Firando at 10 cloth (<i>sic</i>) the last night,
  haveing lost her voyage for Syam this yeare. I went abord, and carid
  a barill of wyne, a quarter pork, and 10 loves bread, with a box bankiting
  stuffe; and, by order of the governer, carid 3 <i>bongews</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> to
  looke the mariners were all retorned and had used their indeavours.
  Capt. Adames was unwilling we should bring any mans name in question,
  for geting us an ill report; soe I did let it pas for that tyme. But
  being enformed that Damian Marines hath bought up 8 or 10 <i>cattis</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of

  for that I wold bring the matter in question before the justice, and
  to same effect wrot an other letter to Damian hym selfe.</p>
<p>And Capt. Garrocho, the Bisken, sent me a peare of crimson silk stockinges

<p class="p2"> <i>June 12.</i>&mdash;Damian Marines came ashore, and tould me Capt.
  Adames had staid his chist with the amber, and that he had receved
  my letter, wherby he knew the occation. I answered hym I did it for
  my own discharg, he being a hired servant, and therfore, by the lawes
  of God and man, ought to look out for the benefite of them which gave
  hym meate, drynke, and wages. And by fortune Capt. Garrocho was in
  company when I debated the matter with hym. Soe I referred the matter
  to hym and Capt. Adames to make an end of it, and I to stand to what
  they ordayned; and soe wrot to Capt. Adames what was determined betwixt
  us, but wished hym to take true notis how many <i>cattis</i> amber
  he had, and to keepe possession of it, etc.</p>
<p>I understood Damian went after to Capt. Jacob Speck,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> unto
  whome (as it should seeme) he had offerd to sell all his amber; and
  so he retorned abord the junck, and Capt. Speck followed hym with a
  pretence to vizet Capt. Adames, but rather to hunt after amber greese.
  God grant Capt. Adames be not guld by them, etc.</p>
<p>I receved 16 boates lading of wheate ashore this day, containing 1,198
  sacks, is 300 <i>gocos</i>, wanting 2 sack laid out in henne meate.
  And Mr. Wickham brought all the merchandiz ashore which they had for
  the Syam voyage, but divers of our pikes had the heads stolne ofe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 13.</i>&mdash;I receved back of Mr. Ric. Wickham a greate bag
  of plate in bars of Lucas Antoinsons, containing seven hundred forty
  and eight <i>taies</i> in bars and <i>fibuck</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> And
  I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> delivered
  fyftie <i>taies</i> in plate of barse to Mr. Nealson. And I receved
  two <i>cattis</i> of amber greese of Mr. Ric. Wickham, which he bought
  for the Worshipfull Company at Liquea. And I receved 3 letters from
  Capt. Adames, how Damian Marin set hym at nought and wold not shew
  hym any amber; so I retorned hym answer not to let hym cary his chist
  ashore, but to bring it to the English howse, which Capt. Adames did,
  but Damian came not with it.</p>
<p>Also I receved 2&frac12; <i>cattis</i> amber of Ed. Sayer, in halves,
  betwixt hym and me; but he willed to take it all, for that he had need
  to use money heare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 14.</i>&mdash;Capt. Garrocho delivered Andrea Dittis, the China
  Capt., his papers of 1,080 and od <i>taies</i> he owed hym, as being
  suretie for an other, and left it to the said Chinas discretion to
  pay or geve hym what he wold. When we came to open Damians chist, there
  was nothing to be found in it. He is a craftie knave. And soe let hym
  goe.</p>
<p>The new botswayn of the junck brought me 2 Liquea brushes and a box of
  synamon of same place, the best that ever I saw in my life. And Jno.
  Japan, our <i>jurebasso</i>,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> brought
  me a present of Liquea cloth, one peec. He hath byn in this place a
  wick, and never came into the English howse till now, but many tymes
  passed before the dore singing like a luneticke man. Soe I put hym
  out of the Companies service, or he rather put hym selfe out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 15.</i>&mdash;Jno. Gorezan the <i>jurebassos</i> wife brought
  a present of Japan apels, or rather other frute lyke appells. Capt.
  Adames sent me a letter from abord the junck at Cochi to have the kinges
  master shipp carpenter com to hym, to confer whether it were fitest
  to trym her at Cochi or bring her to Firando. Damian sent me 2 <i>cattis</i> amber
  by Capt. Adames, rated at 90 <i>taies</i> per <i>catty</i>, resonable
  good, but had byn watered. And I receved back two chistes money of
  Mr. Wickham, wherin he sayeth ther is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> aleven bagges R. of 8, of 500 R. of 8 in eache bagg;
  but I opened not the chistes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 16.</i>&mdash;I sent a letter to Capt. Adames by master carpenter
  to Cochi, about finding out a place to trym our junck in. And I delivered
  1 sack wheate to the baker, to pay in bread as we sell the rest. And
  I had 1 peec Liquea cloth of Mr. Wickham to make Co Jno. of Goto a <i>catabra</i>.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> We
  had much flying news to-day that Shongo Samme was dead. Others said
  it was Calsa Samme, his brother. Others reported Fidaia Samme to be
  alive, and that many <i>tonos</i><a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> were
  gon to hym to take his part. But I esteem all this to be fables. Yet
  others geve out secretly that the Emperour ment to chang the government
  of all these partes, and put other <i>tonos</i> in their places. Soe
  that these of Firando dowbt the retorne of their king.</p>
<p>Tome, my boy, carid out his chist and thought to have run away; but I
  prevented hym, yet turned hym out of dores with a <i>catabra</i> on
  his back as he entred in. He thought to have pickt the lock of my money
  chist the other day, and had so wrong the wardes that I could not open
  the lock with my key, which made me to trune (<i>sic</i>) hym out of
  my chamber. But he, misdowbting ferther disgrace, thought to have carid
  away all his aparell and have geven me the slip.</p>
<p>The purcer of junck gave me 10 Liquea trenchers for a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 17.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Capt. Adames from Cochi,
  wherin he adviseth me that he hath taken counsell about the place most
  fittest to trym our junck in, and findeth Cochi to be the place.</p>
<p>I delivered Mr. Richard Wickham the rich <i>cattan</i><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> he
  left in my custody at his departure towardes Siam. The purcer of the
  junck gave me a greate Liquea cock for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> present, which I sent to Bongo Dono, he being desyrous
  to have hym.</p>
<p>I wrot Capt. Adames answer of his letter receved this day. And I sould
  1,175 sackes wheate (brought from the Liqueas) unto Damian Marin, at
  3 <i>mas</i> per sack, containing 25 <i>gantes</i> Liquea measure,
  to be paid in amber grees, at 115 <i>taies</i> the <i>catty</i>, to
  take 5 <i>cattis</i> and pay the rest in ready money.</p>

<p>I tooke a garden this day and planted it with pottatos brought from the

<p> I gave hym a bill of my hand for soe much money owing hym, to receve

<p>And news came from King of Firando that he arived at Miaco the 18th of
  the last moone, and was admitted awdience with the Emperour the 20th,
  whoe used hym in all kindnes, which causeth much rejoysing here. Also
  the Emperour hath given order into all partes of Japon to look out
  for such as escaped out of the fortres of Osekey when it was burned.
  Soe that prive enquirie was mad in all howses in Firando what strangers
  were lodged in eache howse, and true notis thereof geven to the justice.
  Yt is thought the padres at Langasaque and else where will be narrowly
  looked after. They say the taking of this fortres hath cost above 100,000
  mens lives on the one parte and other, and that on the Prince Fidaia
  Sammes parte no dead man of accompt is found with his head on, but
  all cut ofe, because they should not be knowne, to seek reveing aganst
  their frendes and parents after. Nether (as som say) can the body of
  Fidaia Samme be fownd; soe that many think he is secretly escaped.
  But I canot beleev it. Only the people of these sothern parts speake

  felloes in howse, and he 1 that could do littell or nothing, yet still

  wheate to Damian Marine; and sent my clock by Symon to be mended; and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> som conserves, to invite the king at his retorne, we
  haveing made an end of building our howse. Miguel <i>jurebassos</i> wife
  brought Capt. Adames a <i>catabra</i>, a barell wine, and figges, for
  a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 24.</i>&mdash;Som of Firando barks retorned from Miaco, as others
  did the lyke into all partes of Japon, only the <i>tonos</i> (or king)
  of each parte stay with the Emperour to take <i>danco</i><a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> or
  counsell of what shall be thought needfull; the souldiers being all
  sent home, the wars being ended.</p>
<p>Also I receved a letter from our <i>bungew</i> Ushanuske Dono, dated in
  Miaco le 24th of Gongwach (or the moone past), wherin he writes me
  how well the Emperour receved the King of Firando his master; and that
  a sonne of Fidaia Samme of 7 years ould, by a band woman, was put to
  death by the Emperours comand; and 100 <i>mas</i> and 150 <i>mas</i> a
  head of all them which were in the fortres; soe that dailie many are
  brought in and slaughtered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 25.</i>&mdash;There passed divers boates with men from Fingo<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and
  Shashma to goe to Osekey to make cleane the fortres, and, as it is
  said, they begyn to build the cittie of Osekey and Sackay againe, the
  Emperour having geven order that yf the former owners will not forthwith
  new build their howses, that any other may enter upon the <i>chaune</i> (or
  plot) and build upon it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 26.</i>&mdash;Our fishmonger is run away this night and hath stolne
  a boate of his neighbors. He was here yisterday very ernest with our <i>jurebasso</i> to
  have procured me to have lent hym 10 or 20 <i>tais</i>, and in the
  end desyred hym to have lent hym but one <i>taie</i>, but was deceaved
  of his expectation. And we bought 1<i> c.</i> 9<i> ta.</i> 8<i> ma.</i> amber
  greese of Mr. Wickham for the Wor. Company at 100 <i>taies</i> the <i>catty</i>.</p>
<p>Bongo Dono sent to me to have had a jar of Liquea wyne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> (or <i>rack</i>), for that the Emperour
  hath sent to him to com to Miaco, and therfore he sought
  for such matters to geve in present to grete men for a
  noveltie.</p>
<p>All the kinges barks are com back with the souldiers; only the nobillety
  of all provinces stay with the Emperour. So it is dowbted ther will
  be trucking (or changing of kingdoms); and that which maketh me the
  rather to belive it is the Emperours sending for this man who is the
  last man of the blood royall left behind the king, he being the kinges
  greate uncle and brother to the deceased king Foyne Samme, and is a
  bursen<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> man
  and therefore not fit to be emploied in service, he being above 60
  yeares ould.</p>
<p>And there was flying speeches how the Hollanders had a man kild and much
  money taken in cominge downe from Miaco; but Capt. Speck sent me word
  (I having first advized hym what I heard) that ther was no such matter,
  for that at instant he had receved a letter from their people that
  they were in a port neare unto Shiminasaque, selling goodes and expecting
  wind and wether to com for Firando. And ther is a Japan junk arived
  at Langasaque from Phillippinas, which wintred theare the last yeare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 27.</i>&mdash;Matias the Flemyng retorned from Miaco to Firando;
  but we have no letter from Mr. Eaton, which maketh me to dowbt legerdymeane.</p>
<p>Also Chombo Donos man (a Caffro) came from Miaco with a letter for Oyen
  Dono, and brought word his master was cominge downe for Langasaque,
  and that Safian Dono was ordayned <i>tono</i> (or king) of Arima.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This
  Caffro I gave lodging to in the English howse with meate and drinke,
  because he was servant to such a master.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 28.</i>&mdash;We delivered 500 sackes of wheate to Damian Marin,
  viz., 440 out of our gedong and 60 out of that of Capt. China; so we
  want 1 sack in our gedonge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>And I receaved a packet of letters from Syam, viz., one from Mr. Lucas
  Antoinson of 14th of Aprill, 1 from Mr. Jno. Gourney of the 17th of
  Aprill. Also 2 ould letters from Bantam, viz., 1 from Generall Saris
  of 6 February 1613, 1 from Mr. Georg Bale of 8 Marche, with an other
  humerous letter to Mr. Tempest Peacock, and the lyke to Mr. Ric. Wickham,
  as Mr. Bale is accustomed to doe.</p>
<p>There were two junckes arived at Langasaque from Syam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 29.</i>&mdash;Upon good consideration, per general consent, I
  sent Jno. Pheby to Mr. Eaton with letters and to accompany hym downe
  and procure the Emperours passe for hym, yf need required; which I
  willed Capt. Adames to signefie unto Codskin Dono or Goto Zazabra Dono;
  and gave Mr. Eaton order to com away forthwith, and bring in short
  endes what he could, and to chang the yello in white at Miaco. This
  letter was dated the 27th, but kept till 29th present. Also I sent
  3 letters to our host of Edo and hym of Shrongo,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> with
  the 3d for Sr. Andrea; as also 1 for Miguel <i>jurebasso</i>.</p>
<p>And the brother of Sugien Dono of Umbra<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> retorned
  from the wars and brought me a present of 5 Japan fans.</p>
<p>And I sent an other letter per Jno. Pheby to Oshanusque Dono in answer
  of his receaved 4 daies past from Miaco.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck and Sr. Matias came to vizet me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 30.</i>&mdash;Mr. Nealson paid 10 <i>taies</i> plate bars to Jno.
  Pheby, and I delivered hym my letters for Mr. Eaton, with the others
  for Caseror and Oshenosque Dono. And Capt. Adames wrot to Cogsque Dono
  and Goto Zazabra Dono, to renew our passe yf need require, as also
  to dispach Mr. Eaton away, yf knaves stay hym.</p>
<p>Jno. Jooson arived heare from Miaco, and Unagense Dono and Sugien Dono
  the lyke. And I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to bid them welcom hom, as
  the lyke to Jno. Yoosen. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> sowne after Sugien Dono came to vizet me with a present
  of 10 fannes, and repeated the story of the wars, and how all the nobillety
  of Japon were joyned together at Miaco to viset the Emperour Ogosho
  Samme, which was a marvelous thing to see the hudge number of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 1.</i>&mdash;I went and viseted Bongo Dono, he being ready to
  goe for Miaco; and carid hym 2 barills <i>morofack</i><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>,
  a basket of biskit, 50 roles drid <i>bonita</i>,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and
  5 cords of drid cuttel fish. He took it in good parte, with offer of
  many faire words.</p>
<p>I also envited Capt. Speck, John Yoosen, and the rest of the Duch to dyner
  to morrow. And wrot a letter to Figien Samme, the King of Firando,
  to Miaco, in complimentall sort, as also advising how our junk had
  lost her voyag to Syam and was retorned to Firando from the Liqueas.
  Also, I advised hym how ye King of Ava, of the race of Pegew, had made
  wars 7 yeares, and in the space gotten 8 other kingdoms, which in tymes
  past belonged to the empier of Pegu; and wantes now only to conquer
  Siam, Lanfu, and Camboia, to make hym selfe a greater prince then ever
  any of his ansesters was, and thought very easy to obtayne it, in respect
  of his valientnesse and mighty power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;I receved 2 letters from Capt. Garrocho and Jorge
  Durois, of the 8th and 10th currant, new stile, werin they wrot me
  as apeareth per their letters; but much falce news per Capt. Garrochos
  letter, yf my ame be not amis.</p>
<p>And Capt. Speck, with Jno. Yoosen, Sr. Matias, Jacob Swager, cam to dyner
  to day; and Jno. Yoosen told us a great history of Ogosho Sammas good
  luck in preveling against Fidaia Samme, and that he verely thinkes
  he is dead in the fortrese burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham deliverd me an accompt of Syam voyage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> resting to ballance 132 <i>ta.</i> 3 <i>m.</i> 3 <i>co.</i>,
  but delivered up no money, as he spesyfied in his answer,
  because I owe hym for amber greese, for 1 <i>cat.</i> 9 <i>ta.</i> 8 <i>m.</i> wight,
  at 100 <i>tais catty</i>, 161 <i>ta.</i> 2 <i>m.</i> 5 <i>co.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 3.</i>&mdash;Capt. Speck and the rest sent to thank me for their
  good entertaynment, viz., <i>nifon catange</i>.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 4.</i>&mdash;Jno. Yoosen sent me a drid salmon and divers peeces
  salmon in pickell for a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 5.</i>&mdash;Jno. Jossen came to vizet me to-day, with 5 men wayting
  on hym.</p>
<p>We bought 6 saks rise, per Capt. Adames meanes, at 4 <i>gantos</i> per <i>mas</i> plate
  in bars. I and Ed. Sayer wayed the 3 <i>cattis</i> amber we had in
  halves, and fownd it wanted 7 <i>taies</i>, lacking 2 <i>mas</i> in
  wight.</p>
<p>Her was news (or reporte) geven out that Tushma Tay hath burned Edo in
  the abcence of the Emperour, he haveing left hym prisoner ther under
  the keeping of a yong man, for that he denied to fight against Fidaia
  Samme, the sonne of Ticus Samme his master. But I think this will prove
  a lye, as most Japan news comonly doe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 6.</i>&mdash;A Japon telors wife brought me a present of paper.
  She spoake Spanish, and sought to procur work for her husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 7.</i>&mdash;Here is reports that the Emperour hath staid the
  King of Shashma and all the <i>tonos</i> of these partes, and pretendeth
  to shifte them out of their governmentes (or kingdoms), and put them
  into other provinces to the northward, and them of the northern parts
  in their places. But I rather (in parte) esteem it to be the escape
  of Fidaia Samme, whoe may ly in secret in som of their cuntries, expecting
  opertunety and their retorns; which to prevent, he keepeth them by
  hym till he can understand the certen truth whether he be alive or
  dead.</p>
<p>We had newes that all men that entred into Langasaque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> were staid theare and not sufferd to retorne
  out of the towne. The reason is thought to be to look out
  for such as came out of the fortrese of Osekey; but I rather
  esteem it to be to serche out Fidaia Samme, which is thought
  to be escaped.</p>
<p>Also, one of the king (or <i>tonos</i>) men of this place came and tould
  me that his master had sent for 15 or 20 men of these partes to com
  unto hym, which maketh me now verely to think that he will be shifted
  out of his government or kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 8.</i>&mdash;Ther was paid yisterday, per Mr. Nealson, to Yayemon
  Dono, the kinges ship carpenter, in parte of payment of 150 shething
  plankes for the junck, at 4 <i>mas</i> per planck of 3 fathom and a
  halfe per peece.</p>
<p>I sent Unagense Dono 2 barrills wyne and 4 fishes, he being retorned from
  wars, and now sick of small pox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 9.</i>&mdash;I understand that yisterday the Hollanders cut a
  slave of theirs apeeces for theft, per order of justice, and thrust
  their <i>comprador</i> (or cats buyer) out of dores for a lecherous
  knave, who, with hym that is dead, have confessed of much goods (as
  cloves, mace, pepper, and stuffs) which are stolne per consent of Jacob
  Swager; which maketh much sturr in the Duch howse. Yet I think this
  cates buyer plaieth the knave and defameth Jacob, because he was the
  occation he was thrust out of servyce for haveing to do with his woman,
  the knave being a marid man.</p>
<p>Also Capt. Adames receved a letter from Melchor van Sanfort from Langasaque,
  wherin he adviseth hym that a Japon wold sell us an other junck, and
  to that purpose conselled us to lay up ours. But I had rather som man
  would buy her, for I had rather sell then buy, for I have enough of
  Japon juncks, yf I knew how to better it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 10.</i>&mdash;We had news of 2 China <i>somas</i><a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> arived
  at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> Goto.
  Soe the China Capt. sent a boate to know whence they are.</p>
<p>Also the China Capt. got Capt. Adames to write a letter to Damian to buy
  400 sackes wheate for hym at price they cost, he haveing offerd it
  at same price to hym before, viz., at 3 <i>mas</i> per sack.</p>
<p>And I was enformed that Figen Samme, the king of this place, had sent
  a letter to Bunga Dono, how it was thought the Emperour would make
  Chambo Dono <i>bongew</i> of Arima, Langasaque, and Firando, that is
  to say, of all these sotherne parts. He which sent me word of it was
  Sugen Dono of Umbra, unto whome I sent a present of 2 barills wyne
  and 4 fishes, <i>nifon catange</i>. And he sent his man afterwards
  to thank me for it.</p>
<p>Also Damian retorned from Langasaque, and Symon that was our <i>jurebasso</i> the
  lyke, and brought me my lock back. I gave Mat 1<i>cat.</i> tobaco,
  cost 5 <i>condrins</i>. Bongo Dono went for Miaco this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 11.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Capt. Garrocho, complementall,
  dated in Langasaque, le 18th of July, new stile.</p>
<p>The China Captain, Andrea Dittis, came to me and brought a letter he had
  receaved from his brother out of China: how our busynes consernyng
  procuring a trade into China was in greate hope to take effect, for
  that the greate men had taken 3,000 <i>pezos</i><a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> presented
  them to make way; and that at present the ould king was about to resigne
  up his place to his sonne, and therefore best to let it rest a while
  till the ould man were out of place, or else it would be duble charg
  to geve to father and sonne. Also his cheefe kinsman, whoe is neare
  unto the king, advised that in no hand it should not be geven out that
  we came out of Japon, for that the hatred against Japons was worse
  then against any other nation; but rather to say we came directly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> out of England, or from Bantam, Siam, Camboia, or Cochinchina,
  etc.</p>
<p>Also there is a China com out of the Manillias from Cagallion, and reporteth
  that the Hollanders have taken a place in the Philippinas called Shibou;
  and that, upon this news, all the Spaniards went from Cagallion to
  defend Manillia, as being the place of most emportance. Also he reported
  that Don Juan de Silva, Governor of the Manillias, was secretly slipt
  away, hearing another was coming to take his place; but I esteem this
  a lye. Yet out of doubt he is hated of the most parte, both Spaniardes
  and naturalls, for his covetosnes, as having scraped a world of wealth
  together, he card not how, so he compassed it, as I have byn tould
  by Spaniardes and others, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 12.</i>&mdash;I sent a present to Taccaman Dono, cheefe <i>bongew</i>,
  viz., 2 barills wyne, 5 bundls dry cuttell, and 5 pec. drye <i>bonita</i>,
  which he took in good parte.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 13.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Mr. Eaton, per the purcer of
  our junck. Also I wrot 2 other to our hostes of Osekey and Sackey per
  same conveance. We had much ado to apeace a dispute betwixt the Capt.
  China and Damian for wheate bought, but I entred pledg for China Capt.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck went abord their junck to take vew of her, to sett her out
  before she rott. He sayeth he would send her for Syam; but I rather
  take it to be for the Molucos, to cary provition. He tould me also
  that a Portugez had wrot hym from Langasaque how the Viz Roy de Goa
  had byn at Surat with a power of 7,000 men in many vessels, and had
  put all the English to the sword and spoiled the place; and this news
  he said came per way of Syam, and therfore I know it is a lye, having
  had letters from thence so late, and not a word thereof.</p>
<p>The Capt. China tould me his brothers greate junck was arived from Cochinchina
  at Langasaque.</p>
<p>Kitskin Dono&rsquo;s wyfe dyed this night past.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p> Ther was reportes geven out that 2 shipps were seen ofe at sea neare
  Langasaque, whereof Jno. Yooson advised Capt. Speck. Soe he sent out
  a penisse to look out for them; but I esteem it to be common Japon
  news, which most an end prove lyes. Yet the Duch expect a ship from
  Bantam or Molucos, besides the bark <i>Jaccatra</i> from Pattania and
  a junck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 15.</i>&mdash;I sent Oyen Dono 2 small barills wyne, 2 fyshes,
  and 30 peces drid tuny, not having visited hym since the king went
  from hence; but he was not at home when it came, yet sowne after came
  to the English howse to geve me thanks for it, and tould me of the
  favorable axceptation the king of this place had fownd in all his affares
  with the Emperour.</p>
<p>Also I was advised per a frend in secret how the Duch were coyning falce
  Rs. of 8 at Langasaque, wishing me to take heede how I took any of
  them. And that which maketh me to think it to be true is the tynne
  they bought of me the other day. It seemeth to me a dangerous matter,
  etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 16.</i>&mdash;I gave a <i>tay</i> in small plate to two pore sick
  women of my owne money, the one a China woman, and the other a Japon.
  And ther was 8 pec. red zelas delivered and soald to Tonomon Sama and
  his men, at 1 <i>tay</i> per pece&mdash;8 <i>tais</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 17.</i>&mdash;A cavelero of Umbra came and viseted me, geving
  me thankes for the kindnesse shewed to his kinsman, Sugian Dono, and
  brought me a Japan hargabus (or gun)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> for a present. He asked me many questions about the
  longnes of our voyag, which I shewed hym in a globe. He also enquired
  whether I knew Rome. I answerd I was never at Rome, yet I shewed hym
  the place where it stood. I perceaved per his questioning that he was
  a padre (or semenary prist) and thereupon gave hym a tast that we had
  nothing to doe with the Pope, but esteemed hym only bushop of Rome,
  haveing other bushops in England of as much authorety as he tuching
  spiretuall matters; and that we esteemed not much whether he were our
  frend or enemy, which we left to his choise.</p>
<p>Sent Capt. Speck 1 barell gunpolder out of junk, poz. 1 or 2 <i>cattis</i>,
  duble barell and all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 18.</i>&mdash;I wrot 2 letters to Jorge Durois and Capt. Garrocho,
  advising the Capt. I would take the amber greese, yf it were good,
  or else retorne it back in saffetie; and to Jorge, to buy me 2 or 3
  jarrs conservs and some candells. And ther was delivered unto Capt.
  Adames 202 <i>cattis</i> iron, for use of junk, of the ould iron out
  of ston walles. Also I wrot a letter in Japons to a servant of Mr.
  Lucas Antonison, a Japon at Langasaque, who I am enformed hath the
  duble of my former letters and keeps them by hym.</p>
<p>And ther was 5 <i>taies</i> in plate of bars lent unto Sugien Dono, the
  kinges kinsman, to be repaid at pleasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 19.</i>&mdash;I lent the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, viz., 2 bars
  gould of 55 <i>tais</i> per bar, is 110<i> ta.</i>, 0<i> ma.</i>, 0<i> co.</i>,
  with 200 Rs. of 8 in Spanish money, is 160<i> ta.</i>, 0<i> ma.</i>,
  0<i> co.</i>, to be repaid within 8 or 10 dayes, at his retorne from
  Goto, whether he is bownd to buy matters out of 2 China junkes ther
  arived. This I doe in respeck I hope of trade into China, which now
  I stand in more hope of then eaver. Also he had a bale or <i>corge</i> of
  duttis of 12 Rs. per <i>corge</i>, to make a triall to sell them or
  more to the Chinas.</p>
<p>And Sugian Dono sent his man, desiring to borow 5 <i>tais</i> in plate,
  which on good consideration was lent to hym.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 20.</i>&mdash;I paid 2 <i>mas</i> to Torage, for making 2 <i>kerimons</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> for
  Tuchma and Jno. Goblen, long ago.</p>
<p>Tonemon Donos man came to have borowed 20 <i>taies</i> of me in his masters
  name, but I had not a rag of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 21.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Jno. de Lievana, dated le
  29th of July, new stile, in Langasaque, wherin he advised how Capt.
  Whaows greate junck was arived from Cochinchina; and he which brought
  the letter tould me that other 4 are com from that place in company
  with her, wherof he saw one coming in as he came away. Soe the former
  report of Whaows jonckes arival was an untruth.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how Jno. de Lievana advised that the report of
  the Hollanders being in the Phillipinas is falce, and that Don Jno.
  de Silva was gon to keepe the straites with a gale and a phriggat,
  attending the coming of shipping from Agua Pulca.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 23.</i>&mdash;Ther was flying reports that the Hollanders have
  driven the Spaniards out of the Molucos and entred into the Phillipinas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 24.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. retorned this mornyng from Goto,
  and said that all the Chinas goodes were put into warehowses, and not
  sufferd to sell any thing till the king came, or else order from hym
  to geve them leave. I receved back the two hundred Rs. of eight from
  the China Capt.; but the two bars gould he left in pawne for a junck,
  to receve them back and pay other money in place, etc.</p>
<p>Also the China Capt. gave me a peec of China lynen to mak breeches of,
  etc.</p>
<p>And wee took eight peec. duttis of 8 R. per <i>corg</i> to make a saile
  for our bark. We entertayned a boateman this day at 18 <i>taies</i> per
  ano, named Sinzabra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 25.</i>&mdash;Mr. Wickham being sick, Mr. Nealson, Mr. Sayer,
  and my selfe went to dyner to our frend Skeimon Dono, where we were
  well entertayned. And from thence we went to Duch howse, where Capt.
  Speck tould me he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> receved a letter from Albartus yisterday, wherein he
  advised hym how Mr. Eaton arived at Miaco the first of this moneth,
  and the second went to Sackay to look out for the bark he sent from
  Edo with goods per sea, etc. He also tould me he expected news of 12
  or 14 seale of their shipps to be in the Phillipinas this yeare, to
  cut ofe their China trade for the Manillias, as also to look out for
  the shipping from New Spaine (or Agua Pulca), and then to have 3 or
  4 of them to com for Firando to lade provition. Their plot is great
  and, yf it take effect, will utterly overthrow the Spanish and Portingalle
  dissignes in these partes of the world, etc.</p>
<p>I bought 2 corse <i>catabras</i> for Ingoti, cost 1 <i>mas</i> 9 <i>condrins</i> per
  peec.; paid out per Jno. <i>jurebasso</i>, whoe put away his wife this
  day for trix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 26.</i>&mdash;I sent a letter to Capt. Adames to Cochi with 3
  iron stampers, 2 mattocks, and a pickaxe, and a leg fresh pork and
  5 loves of bread.</p>
<p>Also the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, sent me a legg of pork and an other
  of a goate, he feasting all the Chinas this day, and being ready to
  goe for Langasaque. I sent per hym for his brother, in respeckt his
  junck is retorned from Cochinchina, hoping to heare the truth of our
  maters tuching the losse of our goods and people, as I gave hym in
  charg at my being at Langasaque&mdash;I say I sent hym, <i>nifon catange</i>,
  2 bottells of sallet oyle, and 100 peces drid <i>bonita</i>; and to
  Capt. Andrea Dittis hym selfe 1 barill wyne, and 25 pec. drid <i>bonita</i>.
  And I lent hym 80 Rs. of 8 at his request, he geveing me instance it
  was to geve to certen frendes and parentes com per way of Cochinchina
  out of China, and are to be emploid about our busynes in hand. The
  China Capt. went for Langasaque in the after nowne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 27.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Gonrock Dono, dated in Langasaque
  yisterday, wherin he wrot for stele and tynne for use of the Emperour.
  And I sent a letter to Gonrock Dono, and sent hym 1 bar tyn for sample,
  advising I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> of the same som 190 <i>cattis</i> more, and had soald
  it at 4 <i>mas</i> per <i>catty</i>, and that this or what else was
  at the Emperours servis.</p>
<p>Our hostis of Tomo came per this place, being bound for Langasaque; and
  sent her sonne to me with a present of 2 barilles wine and other <i>recado</i>,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> <i>nifon
  catange</i>. Also Jno. Yosen arived from Langasaque, and sent me a
  present of peares. And our new botswan of junck brought me a present
  of dry fish and 2 small barills of wyne. Also I receved an other letter
  from Jorge Durois with 20 musk millans. His 2 letters dated the 2th
  and 5th day of August, new stile. He writes of much news of a flett
  of 5 seale, to be arived at Manillia from New Spaine, with men, money,
  and munition, against the Duch at the Molocos; but I think it fabulose,
  as the rest of ther Goa forses to take and spoile Suratt. Also it is
  reported that Fidaia Samme is escaped into Shashma or the Liqueas;
  but I rest dowbtfull whether it be soe or no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 28.</i>&mdash;I delivered 8 R. of 8 and 1 pec. <i>fibuck</i> to
  our gouldsmith, to plate my rapier and dagger. And a cheefe man sent
  me a present of a barill of wyne, 2 chickeing, and 5 musk millions,
  and the like to Capt. Adames, in respeckt his servant is entertayned
  for a marrener in our junck voyage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 29.</i>&mdash;This day Zenzebars wyves brother sent for Jno. Gorezano
  our <i>jurebasso</i> to com and speake with hym, and laid to his charge
  that he had geven out bad speeches of hym that he had put men to death
  without any reason (for yow must understand this fello is the hangman
  or execuseoner of this place, an office of reputation in these partes
  of the world). But our <i>jurebasso</i> denied it that he spoake no
  such matter; yet that wold not serve his turne; but I was glad to send
  Capt. Adames to take up the matter. I know this came by meanes of the
  Duch, or ther <i>jurebasso</i>, Symon, who I put away. These are trix.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 30.</i>&mdash;I sent Capt. Speck a quarter of beefe. Much a dow
  had I this day about clearing our <i>jurebasso</i> Goreson, whome Zanzebar
  and his wives rase thought to have destroyed, and, as I take it, at
  the instigation of the Duch. For they sent me word, as I was at dyner,
  that for my sake they had saved his life, yet would have hym to avoid
  the towne within 5 or 6 dayes. I retorned them answer, I held them
  for no justices nor judges, and that I had need of my <i>jurebassos</i> service;
  but the felloe which came on the messadge was soe forward in his speeches
  that he tould me, yf I sent him not away, that those fellowes servantes
  would kill hym as he went in the street. Yow must understand his adversaries
  are the hangmen or execusioners of the towne. But I retorned answer
  that I was under the protection of Ogosho Samme the Emperour, and had
  it under his ferme, that no justice in Japan might meddell with me
  nor no servant in my howse, but per the Emperours permition, and yet
  more larger then I spake it; and therefore I warned them upon their
  heads, as they would answer it with their whole generation, that they
  should not tuch hym till the king of this place retorned. Which answer
  put them into such a quandare, that they sent me word that, for my
  sake, they were content to pardon hym of all matters and to be his
  frend. This word was sent me per Capt. Adames, whome, before God and
  man, I must needs blame for taking part with that vild fello Zanzabar, <i>alias</i> Yasimon
  Dono, whom, per experience, I have found to be an absolute cuning knave,
  and therupon have donne all I can to make Capt. Wm. Adames to know
  it; yet he still esteemeth hym more then all our English nation, and
  still he would pawne his lyfe and soule for his honestie. And I cannot
  chuse but note it downe, that both I my selfe and all the rest of our
  nation doe see that he (I meane Mr. Wm. Adams) is much more frend to
  the Duch then to the Englishmen, which are his owne contremen, God
  forgeve hym.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I leave it to his owne contience, and to God and the
  world, to be judges with what respect I have used hym ever since we
  came into Japan.</p>
<p>An other matter is now set on foote, which I never did heare of till this
  instant; and is, that we were cozened of 4 or 500 <i>taies</i> (yf
  not more) in the price we paid for our junck, and that it was parted
  betwixt Zanzabar, our host Andrea at Langasaque, and other their copsmates,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> wherof
  Miguel our <i>jurebasso</i> was one, and had 50 <i>taies</i> for his
  share; but as yet I can fynd no witnese of the truth, yet I verely
  beleeve it to be true, although Capt. Adams have no hand in the matter.
  For with their smoath speeches they make a childe of hym, and soe do
  what they list, and he will not beleeve any man that will speake to
  the contrary. And thus much thought I good to note downe, that it may
  be extant whether I live or dye.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck, Jno. Yoosen, and Mr. Matias came unlooked for to the English
  howse to supper. Capt. Speck tould me he understood that Mr. Eaton
  was on his way coming from Miaco. God send hym well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 31.</i>&mdash;Gonosco Dono, our guardians father in law, sent
  Mr. Wickham and me 2 peare pigions. This Gonosco Dono is left cheefe <i>bongew</i> or
  Vizroy in abcence of the king and Nobasane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 1.</i>&mdash;The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, retorned from Langasaque
  and brought me a present from his brother, viz., 1 faire <i>kitesoll</i>,
  2 spoutpots or ewers of tynn silverd, 2 pec. China lynen, and 1 peec.
  silk lane; and he hym selfe sent a white <i>catabra</i>. He sayeth,
  tuching our affares in Cochinchina, that the kyng denyeth that he never
  was consenting to the death of our people, nether knew of it till it
  was donne, it being donne per the Japons and not per his people; and
  that for the money he owed us for the goods he bought of Mr. Peacock
  he was willing to pay it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> but non came to demand it; and for the rest of our goods
  it was retorned back to our junck it cam in, etc.; and offred to geve
  the China (our soliceter) his letter or passe for any mans safe coming
  that I would send to receve it. But yow must understand Capt. Speck
  sent a Japon about the lyke matter for the Hollanders, with a present
  for the king, which he receaved. But this Japon lodged in the howse
  of another Japon theefe, where they handled the matter soe amongst
  them that the king retorned word of mouth to Capt. Speck that he would
  not make them restetution of any thing, and, yf they sent any more
  shiping, he would use them as he did the other. And those Japon theeves,
  knowing how the king had promised restetution, went to hym and perswaded
  hym to the contrary, telling hym that, yf he made restetution to us,
  he must doe the lyke to the Hollanders. Soe that when the China, our
  soliceter, went for the kinges letter, he denyed it hym. Thus the second
  tyme were we crost per the Hollanders.</p>
<p>And I thought good to note downe that the China Capt., Andrea Dittis,
  came and tould me how his brother Whaw at Langasaque desired to have
  it under my hand writing tuching procuring trade into China. For, as
  he sayeth, they have laid out 3,000 <i>taies</i> allready to make way,
  and make reconying it will cost them 5,000 <i>taies</i> more, is all
  8,000 <i>taies</i> (I say eight thousand <i>taies</i>); which, yf in
  case they procure us free trade into China, we are to pay them the
  said eight thousand <i>taies</i> back, with what else shall be thought
  fiting. But yf they do not procure us free trade into China, the losse
  to stand upon them selves.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how Jorge Durois wrot me how a greate Holland ship
  was cast away on the cost of Lucan in the Phillippinas, out of the
  which the contrey people saved 5 greate peeces of ordinance, and that
  most parte of the men were cast away in the ship, and those which escaped
  per swyming were taken prisoners and sent to Manillia to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> Don Juan de Silvas, whoe they say is ready with forcese
  to depart to reskew them at the Molucas; but I can hardly beleeve it.</p>
<p>Also a frend of Capt. Adames tould hym that three daies past arived an
  emptie junck at Langasaque, which came from Cagallon in the Phillippinas,
  and is one of the Japan junckes which we thought was lost with ours
  which Water Carwarden was in, and came out of Cochinchina 7 daies before
  our junck could be ready to departe, and was driven on the cost of
  Cord (<i>sic</i>) per stormy wether, and put among the ilands Liqueas,
  yet could not recover port in any of them; yet after recovered the
  iland of Lucan and put into the roade of Cagallan, having first lost
  their mastes and throwne all their goods overbord, being glad to escape
  with life; and from thence are now retorned with the emptie junck,
  but know nothing of what is becom of ours.</p>
<p>Also this day we put away Fachman, our scullion, and Mr. Nealson paid
  hym to cleare his accompt.</p>
<p>And I sent Capt. Adames to Cochi, viz.,</p>

<p> Also I sent hym 3 loves of bread, and wrot hym the news of that junk
  which was reported to hym came from Cagallion is untrew, for it is
  a junk belo[ng]ing to the China Capt. brother, and came not from Cochinchina
  last yeare; so that is a lye.</p>
<p>And we entertayned a new skullion named Sayemond at one <i>tay</i> per
  month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 2.</i>&mdash;I gave Matinga 6 <i>taies</i> small plate to buy
  rise; and I had 14 onces black silk of China Capt., cost 2 <i>taies</i> per <i>catty</i>.</p>
<p>I had much adowe with Zanzabars desemvery,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> who
  sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> me
  word 3 or 4 tymes they would break my <i>jurebassos</i> boanes, yf
  he came to his owne howse; but, as before, soe still I retorned them
  answer they should take heed how they medled with any servant I had.
  And at night my <i>jurebasso</i> being desirous to goe to his howse,
  I gave hym leave; where he found Jno. Devins entertaynment<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>;
  for Zanzabers wives brother, with other consortes, set upon hym in
  the streete, and, had he not by good fortune gotten into a howse, they
  had slayne him. And about midnight, being garded per a gentlemans servant,
  my frend came home againe, shaking every joint of hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 3.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. being ready to goe for Goto, I
  lent hym our boate and wastclothes, and delivered hym back 120 Rs.
  of 8, which was the rest of the 200 Rs. 8 lent hym before and retorned,
  the other being delivered hym after at his going to Langasaque, viz.,
  80 Rs. of 8. Also I paid hym 38 <i>mas</i> in Rs. of 8 for 1 <i>cattie</i> silk
  at 20 <i>mas</i>, and 3 peces red China taffetie at 18 <i>mas</i>,
  is 4&frac34; Rs. 8.</p>
<p>And tuching the force used against my <i>jurebasso</i> the other night,
  I thought good, with the advice of the rest, to make it knowne unto
  the cheefe justice in the kinges abcence, Mr. Wickham accompanying
  me. They all tould me I had greate reason in what I did, and that they
  would take order that this <i>bongew</i> should not offer my <i>jurebasso</i> any
  wronge; the which I certefied Capt. Adames of in good termes by a letter
  sent hym to Cochi, where I heard he la sick. But he retorned me a very
  harsh answer, as all the rest of our cuntremen can witnesse which saw
  it. He shewed hym selfe a fermer frend to Zanzaber and his consortes
  then to me and the rest of his contremen.</p>
<p>Also Capt. Speck sent for Mr. Wickham to com and speak with hym, and complained
  much of my <i>jurebasso</i>, that he had a bad tonge and had geven
  out vild reports of hym and his nation. I retorned hym answer, I never
  heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> hym
  use any such speeches, and, yf he thought me hys frend, he might think
  I could not endure neather hym nor any other use such speeches, without
  geveing him notis therof and chastesing the speakers, yf they were
  my servants. In fine, his desire was to have me to send for these <i>bongewes</i> and
  to make an end of these matters in frendship; unto which I answerd
  that I knew not whether they would com or no, yf I sent for them, yet,
  yf there were any meeting, I desired that Capt. Adames might be present,
  and they should not find me out of reason. And soe I advised Capt.
  Adames, allthough he burdened me I went about to meyntayne a theefe
  against all reason, which all men may think that heare hym say soe
  that no honest man would doe it.</p>
<p>And I had allmost forgot to note downe how I delivered a writing to Andrea
  Dittis, the China Capt., under my hand and seale, witnessed by Mr.
  Ric. Wickham, Mr. Wm. Nealson, and Mr. Ed. Sayer; wherin I consorted
  with hym and Capt. Whaw, his brother, and a therd brother which they
  have in China, that yf they procure us trade into China, to repay them
  all such sums of money and money worth as they should lay out in procuring
  thereof; but yf it tooke not effect, then the losse to light upon them
  selves. And they are to turne an other writing to me, to use their
  best endevour in doing therof only for Englishmen and no nation else
  whatsoever. And soe the Lord God grant a good suckcesse to our proceadings.</p>
<p>I wrot 2 letters to Jorge Durois and Damian Marin, and receved 1 from
  Jno. de Lievano of the 11th of August, new stile, of complementos.
  But I wrot Georg Durois to buy us a peare of milstones and som candells,
  and send them per first [ship].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 4.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames sent me a more frendly letter then
  before. He is two much affection towardes Zanzaber, and wholy led away
  by hym.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 5.</i>&mdash;Thear is reportes geven out that the Portingal
  shipp is arrived at Langasaque from Amacau, and presently after Capt.
  Speck wrot me a letter that it is the same greate shipp which was there
  the last yeare; but, as Jno. Yoosen hath advised hym, she is not soe
  well laden as she was the yeare past, but, as it should seeme, cometh
  more to fetch away the lagg they left heare the last yeare then for
  any thing else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 6.</i>&mdash;I hearing the sea <i>bongew</i> was gon up to the
  king, and dowbting he might enforme untruthes against my <i>jurebasso</i>,
  was determined to have written 2 letters, 1 to the king, and another
  to Chumba Dono, my <i>jurebassos</i> ould master, to desire them not
  to geve eare to his enemies falce reportes; but, as I was about to
  have donne it, Tackamon Dono sent unto me his cheefe man, be being
  accompanied with Skidayen Dono and Nicolas Martin, his <i>jurebasso</i>.
  And his desire was that, for his sake, I would geve over the pursute
  of this matter against the sea <i>bongew</i>, for that, yf it were
  followed, of force the said <i>bongew</i> must cut his bellie, and
  then my <i>jurebasso</i> must do the lyke. Unto which his request I
  was content to agree, and afterward went to geve hym thankes for the
  paynes he had taken in the matter, he having promised me that non should
  be so hardy to meddell with my <i>jurebasso</i> hereafter, and that
  he would take the matter in hand to make the accord betwixt hym and
  his wife.</p>
<p>And from Tacaman Donos, I went to the Duch howse, where, amongst other
  matters, we fell into discourse about the <i>bongews</i> proceedinges
  against my <i>jurebasso</i>, he taking the <i>bongews</i> part, and
  tould me he had donne well yf he had cut hym in peeces the other [day],
  and then their would have byn no more words therof afterward. But I
  made hym answer that it might be he was deceaved in that, for that
  I would have brought the matter in question, and it might be would
  have cost both hym and others their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> lives, for that all the justice of Firando said that
  the <i>bongew</i> had donne that which he could not answer. Once I
  fownd my selfe agreeved that he had me in soe small respect that he,
  without geveing notis unto me, sent craftely for my <i>jurebasso</i> out
  of my howse, thinking to have put hym to death without any forme of
  processe; and he replid and said that the <i>bongew</i> was a souldier,
  and stood upon his honer more than his lyfe, and card not to cut his
  belly upon such an occation. I answered, I did not esteem this <i>bongew</i> such
  a personage that he needed to take pepper in the nose soe much as he
  did.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how I carid a jarr of China beare and 5 stringes
  drid fish to Tacamon Dono for a present.</p>
<p>This <i>bongew</i> and Capt. Speck are all one, and I know this trowble
  against my <i>jurebasso</i> came, the beginning of it, from the Duch
  howse.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck came late to the English howse, and Sr. Matias with hym, and
  desired my company to goe and see a peece of ordinance cast; which
  I did, but marveled at their workmanship. For they carid the mettell
  in ladells above 20 yardes from the place where the mould stood, and
  soe put it in, ladelfull after ladell, and yet made as formall ordinance
  as we doe in Christendom, both of brasse and iron. Capt. Speck tould
  me nether workmanship nor stuffe did not stand hym in halfe the price
  it cost them in Christendom.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck tould me he receaved a barks lading of copper this day from
  Sackay, and that his barke departed from thence 3 daies after Mr. Eaton
  was departed from thence. God send hym hither in saffety.</p>
<p>And we bought 22 bags rise of Zazabra Dono for 4 <i>gantes</i> a <i>masse</i>,
  and delivered 12 bagges of them to our ship carpenters upon accompt.
  They beging to work upon our junk to morrow. God be their good speed,
  etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 7.</i>&mdash;Gonosco Dono came to the English howse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> and amongst other talk tould me that the
  King had sent hym word to burne all the tobaco, and to
  suffer non to be drunk in his government, it being the
  Emperours pleasure it should be so; and the like order
  geven thorowghout all Japon. And that he, for to begyn,
  had burned 4 <i>piculls</i> or C. wight this day, and cost
  him 20 <i>taies pico</i>; and had geven orders to all others
  to doe the like, and to pluck up all which was planted.
  It is strange to see how these Japons, men, women, and
  children, are besotted in drinking that herb; and not ten
  yeares since it was in use first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 8.</i>&mdash;The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, retorned from Goto,
  for that the <i>bongew</i> would not let hym enter into that place,
  he haveing staid 4 daies a weating, and so retorned. Also they of Goto
  staid 3 <i>somos</i>, or small junkes, theare of his, which were bound
  for Firando, and would not let them passe, but send out boates to bring
  in by force all such junks as passe within sight. And for shark oyle,
  ther was but 25 littill jarrs, all which was taken per Gonrock Dono
  and sent to Langasaque for his proper use.</p>
<p>And he adviseth me that 4 juncks are arived at Langasaque from Chanchew,
  which, with this ship from Amacau, will cause all matters to be sould
  cheape.</p>
<p>The China Capt. of a junck at Goto sent me a peece white damaske, present.</p>
<p>We had newes this day that the Portingales of Amacau have taken the bark <i>Jaccatra</i>,
  and meane to set out 2 men of war every yeare to take all English and
  Duch that trade from Syam, Bantam, and Pattania for these partes.</p>
<p>But, within 2 howres after, the bark <i>Jaccatra</i> arived on the cost
  of Firando, and brought in a Portingall junck which came from Champa,
  wherin both Chinas and Japons are marreners. She took her on this cost
  3 daies past, at an iland called Sta. Clare. Her lading is black wood,
  I think ebony. It is thought the Portingales will complaine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> to the Emperour, because the Hollanders take them within
  his dominions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 9.</i>&mdash;Cushcron Dono lent us 50 <i>taies</i> in great
  plate for a few daies, which 50 <i>taies</i> Mr. Nealson receaved to
  lay out in necessaris for the juncke.</p>
<p>And about midnight past the other Holland shipp, called the <i>Ancusen</i>,
  of som 300 tonns, arived in the roade (or harbor) of Cochi. And after
  nowne both shipps came into the harbour of Firando. And I went abord
  of them, and carid 2 barills wine, a hogg, 5 hense, and 10 loves bread
  to the greate ship; 1 barell wyne and the lyke quantety of the rest
  to the littell ship.</p>
<p>They tould me that the English shipp which is to com hither is called
  the <i>Oziander</i>, and the masters name Jno. Hunt; and that she would
  be ready to com after them within 4 or 5 daies, but have brought no
  letters for us, which maketh us to marvill. And I must needs condem
  Mr. Denton and them at Pattania of sloth, or else the Duch of legerdemeane.</p>
<p>They report a parliament in England,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and
  that it is lyke we shall have wars with Spaine; and that the Lady Elizabeth
  hath a yong sonne per the Palsgrove of the Ryne.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p>Also they say that Capt. David Midelton was generall of an other fleete
  to Bantam, and, understanding of his brothers death, retorned to England.</p>
<p>Oyen Dono sent me a present of 15 hense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 10.</i>&mdash;I sent out our penisse with 16 men to roe, and
  the Capt. China, Andrea Dittis, in her, with an English flag and wastclothes
  and a letter, to lye ofe and on 8 or 10 dayes, to put a pilot abord
  our shipp yf she com on the cost. He had a bar plate, poz. 4 <i>taies</i> 5 <i>condrin</i>,
  and 1 <i>tay</i> in small plate, to lay out in provition for rowers,
  and a barrill of wyne, etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 11.</i>&mdash;Our neighbour of Faccatay sent me 2 hennse; and
  Tonsho Samma sent to envite me and the rest of our nation to dyner,
  but I exskewsed it till an other tyme. And Taccamon Dono sent his man
  to me to tell me that he had donne what he could to make peace betwixt
  our <i>jurebasso</i> Gorreson and his wife, but that shee would not
  in any sort retorne back unto hym, although she should suffer death;
  and that Bongo Donos wife had taken her under his protextion, and said
  he should not have her againe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 12.</i>&mdash;I sent Capt. Adames 3 hense and 6 loves bread,
  he having written for charcole, lyme, and oyle for the junk, but could
  not be sent per meanes of the rayne.</p>
<p>Also I receved 2 letters from Langasaque from Jno. de Lievana and Jorge
  Durois, of the 19th and 20th currant, new stile, wherein they write
  me much news, viz., that Don Jno. de Silva hath a fleet of 15 gallions,
  8 or 9 gallies, with many friggates and China <i>somas</i>, to transport
  an army of 3,000 souldiers to the Molucos against the Duch; and that
  3 gallions came from Aguapulca to the Manillias with halfe a million
  of plate for the setting forward of those affares against the Hollanders;
  and that a new Viz Roy was sent to Goa, called Don Jeronimo de Torres,
  and knight of the order of St. Yago, and is likewaies ordayned governor
  of the Phillipinas, and carrieth 200 substantiall Spaniards with hym
  to Goa, amongst whome 1 is apointed for visitor, being well assisted
  with other Spaniardes, a thing never seen in the Portingall Indies
  before; and that no matter may passe but per his permission; and that
  he hath sent away Don Diego de Bascon√ßelos, the former Viz Roy, in
  cheanes for Portingale till he be out of sight of land, and confiscat
  all his goodes, which vallued above 200,000 rialles of 8, because he
  denied to send succors the last yeare to Don Jno. de Silva to have
  gon against the Hollanders at Molucos, for which it is thought he will
  loose his head, yf he live to com into Portingale.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>Many other matters they write me, as of the duble mariadg betwixt the
  princese of France and Spaine; and that the King of Spaine hath marid
  the Duke of Savoies daughter;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and
  that the said Duk was generall in an armado per sea aginst the Turke,
  where the Christians tooke 150 of the Turks gallis; and that the King
  of France hath made 12 new gallions and sent them to the sucker of
  his father in law, the King of Spaine, with such forcese, that they
  and the Archduke have taken 20 seale of Holland shipps which were prepared
  to goe for the East Indies, and also have taken 3 citties or townes
  from the Hollanders; but I esteeme this a fable, for this Holland ship
  now com for Firando came out of Holland but 14 moneths past.</p>
<p>Many other matters they wrot of, which is overlong to set downe, namely,
  that the Kinge of Spain was sending an embassador to the Emperour of
  Japon with a greate present, in respect of his favour to Christians.
  So it seemeth he did littell know how he hath formerly banished all
  Christians out of his dominions: I meane all fryres, monkes, jesuists,
  and pristes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 13.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Nealson with our <i>jurebassos</i> to
  Taccamon Dono, to desire his Lordship that Goresonas wife might be
  forthcoming at the kinges retorne to Firando, to answer to what her
  husband would aleadg against her, for that her proceadinges were a
  dishonor both to hym and me; which he retorned me word was true, and
  that yf she had byn a man, as she was a woman, he would have taken
  an other course then that he had donne, for that in some sort women
  have more privelege then men.</p>
<p>And sowne after, Taccaman Donos man wrot a letter to Gorisan to com and
  speake with hym, which he did, and was per his masters order, whoe
  tould Goresano that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> better considered of the matter, and that, yf he would,
  he would make his wife retorne againe to hym, whether she would or
  no; or else, yf I would, he would cause her nose to be cut ofe and
  banish her out of the cuntrey. This new change is per reason that,
  yf this matter of his wife be brought in question before the king,
  the other of the sea <i>bongew</i> must be the lyke, which would be
  nothing to the lyking of Zanzabar and his rase, etc.</p>
<p>And after nowne the capten and masters of the 2 Duch shipps came to the
  English howse and brought me a present of 2 baricas of Spanish wine,
  3 Hollands cheeses, 2 small potts of butter, and a bundell of stockfish.</p>
<p>And about midnight Mr. Eaton arived at Firando from Miaco, and, as he
  tells me, hath lent 100 bars of gould to the King of Firando, to be
  paid againe at 3 months; which is such a greefe unto me in respect
  of the presant use we have of money, that I know not what to doe. I
  did littell think Mr. Eaton would have served me so, I haveing written
  hym expresly to the contrary. Mr. Eaton sayeth the common report is
  that Fidaia Samme is yet living, with 5 or 6 other principall men,
  and thought to be in Shashma.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaton brought me 5 letters as followeth, viz., 1 from King of Firando,
  with 2 <i>catabras</i>, from Miaco; 1 from Ushenusque Dono, our <i>bongew</i>,
  from Miaco; 1 from our host of Osekey, Yasozama Amanoia Dono; 1 from
  Gilbert Cunings wife, from Edo; 1 from Andrea, Capt. Adams brother
  in law, from Edo. Mr. Eaton tills me how this Andrea and Mickmoy, our
  host, dealed Judasly with hym at Edo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 14.</i>&mdash;Sugian Dono sent me a present of new rise, <i>nifon
  catange</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 15.</i>&mdash;I receaved of Mr. Wm. Eaton, for goodes sould
  for my owne accompt in Japan, plate barse, fyve hundred threescore
  and nyne <i>taies</i>, one <i>mas</i>, and five <i>condrines</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>and in plate barse, for acco. of the Wo<sup>ll</sup> Company,
  one thousand two hundred and fiftie <i>taies</i>; and in Priaman gould,
  po. ten <i>taies</i>, I say ten <i>taies</i> wight Priaman gould, and
  is the rest of a greater som delivered unto hym at his going up to
  Osekey heretofore. And I gave hym a peece ashculler grogren of my owne,
  cost me 11&frac12; <i>tais</i>, as also a paire of blew stockinges,
  cost me 3 <i>taies</i>. Jno. Yossen retorned from Langasaque, and sent
  me a present of grapes.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter to Capt. Adames, of the knavery of Miguel, our <i>jurebasso</i>,
  how Judas like he dealt with Mr. Eaton at Edo, and since his coming
  still abcentes hym selfe night and day, thinking I will beare with
  his fooleries as well as Mr. Eaton did, which he did of meare necessitie,
  not knowing how to mend hym selfe. Yet I am in no such need, but meane
  to put away the knave for his knavery.</p>
<p>And I receaved a letter from Capt. Garrocho, dated in Langasaque, le 22th
  of this month, new stile, wher inclosed came an other for the China
  Capt. Alsoe he wrote me to buy a case of bottells, a lookinglas, and
  2 Holland cheeses for hym, etc.</p>
<p>There was geven to the owner and master of the boate which brought downe
  Mr. Eaton two peces of white <i>baftas</i> of 10 R. per <i>corge</i>,
  in regard of the paines they tooke in bringing hym downe, etc.</p>
<p>And I sent a barell of wine and a bundell of paper to Gonosque Dono, and
  the lyke to Taccamon Dono, per Mr. Eaton newly returned from Miaco;
  which they tooke in good parte. And in the after nowne Semi Dono retorned
  from above, and sent his man to advise me therof (<i>nifon catange</i>).
  Soe I went to viset hym, in company of Mr. Wickham and Mr. Eaton, and
  carid him 2 barilles of <i>morofack</i> and 51 peces of drid bonita.
  Also I sent a barill of wyne and millions to Jno. Yoosen, per Mr. Eaton,
  in respect he holpe hym at Edo, his <i>jurebasso</i> playing the knave,
  viz., Miguel. He took it in good part, and envited me to breakfast
  the next morning with [hym]. Jno. Yoosens brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> envited hym abord the greate shipp, and had 7 peces
  ordinance shot afe at his retorne ashore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 16.</i>&mdash;Mr. Eaton and I went to diner to Jno. Yoosen,
  where we met Capt. Speck, Sr. Mattias, and the masters and capt. of
  the ships, with Jno. Yoosens brother. And at our retorne we found Mr.
  Wickham and Mr. Nealson a littell intostecated, but Ed. Sayer stark
  drunk; and he and Mr. Nealson fell together per the eares with daggers
  drowne in very wild sort, and Mr. Wickhams tong ran at large.</p>
<p>And Bongo Donos wife in his abcense sent me a present of millans.</p>
<p>And Jno. Goreson our <i>jurebasso</i> brought his wife to the English
  howse, where we made them good frends. And Lues Martin came to Firando.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 17.</i>&mdash;A Spaniard called Albaro Monues brought me a letter
  from Capt. Garrocho, with 14 onces of amber grees, which he wrot me
  cost hym 95 <i>taies</i> the <i>catty</i>, and esteemed it worth 110 <i>taies</i> the <i>catty</i>.
  But I retorned it back by the same bringer, as not being worth the
  price he wrot me it cost.</p>
<p>And I receved a jarr of conserves from George Durois, with 25 peares,
  which the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, took per way.</p>
<p>I was advised to send to Andrea, our host at Langasaque, to buy 5 or 600 <i>gantes</i> of
  shark oyle at the price of 100 <i>taies</i> the C., as he advised Capt.
  Adames he could have as much as we stood in need of. This I meane to
  doe to try conclutions, to see whether wordes and deeds are alyke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 18.</i>&mdash;I went to Cochi to vizet Capt. Adames and see
  our junck work. Went forward and carid hym a bottell Spanish wyne,
  2 hens, 1 duk, a pece pork, 8 loves bread and 6 millans, and returned
  to Firando to dyner, haveing invited Albaro Monues, whoe tould me the
  Duch mariners used hym ill yisterday in wordes, calling hym Cornudo,
  he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> being
  a marid man. Wherupon grew som quarrell, for which 4 or 5 Duch mariners
  were duckt at yard arme and each one 40 strips at capstayn.</p>
<p>Also the China Capt. retorned in our bark, the wind being still contrary,
  and, haveing given order along the cost to send our pilotes yf our
  ship came in sight, he went to Langasaque and staid halfe a day, and
  bringeth word that his brother tould hym that the common report amongst
  both Spaniards and Portingals was that now they took the English to
  be their enimis, as well as the Hollanders, and therfore would take
  all our shipps which traded into these partes of the world, etc. But
  I remember the ould proverb, that &ldquo;God sends a curst cow short
  hornes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I find on a sudden that Mr. Wickham grows very sullen humorous and, as
  I am informed, geveth out that he is not the Companies servant, but
  at will, and therfore will rather seek out for his retorne for England
  in some shiping from Langasaque to Syam or Pattania. I think the reason
  is that he hath fingerd 5 or 6 <i>cattis</i> of good amber grees in
  the Liqueas, and thinketh to make an India voyag for hym selfe, and
  to retorne Capt. or Generall for the Company at his pleasure. Once
  truly I, and I think all the rest of the English in these parts, desyre
  rather his rowme then company. He is turbulent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 19.</i>&mdash;Taccamon Dono sent me a present of 8 hense. And
  I wrot a letter to Capt. Adames how the China Capt.&rsquo;s brother had lent
  us 325 <i>gantes</i> of shark oyle, and therefore wished hym to send
  a man to Andrea, our host, to buy 4 or 500 <i>gantes</i> oyle at 10 <i>tais</i> per
  hundred <i>gantes</i>, as he enformed us their was enough to be had,
  to the entent we may pay what we owe and have to serve our turne. And
  I delivered fyftie <i>taies</i> plate bars to Mr. Nealson to lay out
  about charg of junck.</p>
<p>And Mr. Nealson paid Yaiemon Dono, our junk carpenter, forty 8 <i>taies</i> in
  plate of bars, and is in full payment for 170
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> plankes for the junck at 4 <i>mas</i> per peece; the
  rest, being 20 <i>taies</i>, was paid per hym before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 20.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Capt. Adames from Cochi,
  dated this day, how a bark with Spaniards from Langasaque put into
  that roade and came from Mallia<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in
  shiping. The[y] say Don Lues de Fashardo did fight with 20 seale of
  Hollanders bound for the East Indies, and hath sunk or taken 12 of
  them, and the rest escaped by flight. Also the[y] say the King of Spaine
  hath wars with the Turk, and that this news is come from Madrid in
  6 months per way of New Spaine.</p>
<p>And, after all, the Spaniardes came to the English howse, viz., Miguel
  de Salinas, Capten Medina, and a Jerman called Marcus, with Alferis
  Tuerto and Lues Martin, and Albaro Monues accompanied them. They used
  many complementos and tould me of Don Lues Fachardos discomforting
  the Holand flete going for the East Indies, but after such a divers
  sort that I can scarce beleeve it to be true; as also that 4 sayle
  of English shipps were passed the Straites of Magilanus into the South
  Sea.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck sent for 10 bars tynne, poiz. 9 <i>cattis</i> 4 <i>tay</i> wight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 21.</i>&mdash;I sent Capt. Adames a barill of <i>singe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> 3
  hense, and 6 loves of bread, with peares. And I wrot a letter to Andrea,
  our host at Langasaque, and sent it per a man called Miguel, an offecer
  of our junck apointed per Capt. Adames; and sent per hym one hundred
  and fiftie <i>taies</i> in plate of bars, to pay for such hempe, sayles,
  and canes, as Andrea had bought for junck before, and 800 <i>gantos</i> of
  oyle. Also I wrot to Jorge Durois how I had receved the milstones,
  a jar of conserve, and 25 peares, without letter; and desired hym to
  buy me an other jar conserve of sitrons or lemons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>And at night the Spaniardes envited them selves to our <i>fro</i>,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> whom
  I entertayned in the best sort I could. Also Semidono had envited hym
  selfe to our <i>fro</i> before, but after sent me word he could not
  com, being sick of the sullens, because I would not lend hym money,
  being well experienced of his payment before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 22.</i>&mdash;Semidone being necessitous and in cheefe office
  in the kinges abcense, and now demanding but 20 <i>taies</i>, I have,
  with generall consent, lent hym 20 <i>taies</i>, to be repaid at a
  month, as apeareth per his bill. And I delivered 50 <i>taies</i>, I
  say fiftie <i>taies</i>, to Mr. Nealson, to lay out in charges of junck;
  the 20 <i>taies</i> to Semidone being paid per Mr. Nelson.</p>
<p>Semidone came to our <i>fro</i>, accompanyed with Gonosque Dono and divers
  other caveleros, whome (as I think) I entertayned to content.</p>
<p>And Capt. Adames came from Cochi in a greate rage against my <i>jurebasso</i>,
  Jno. Goresano, saying he was the occation the carpenters went not to
  work upon our junck. But this I know was an untruth, and the master
  carpenter and Zanzabers knavery. And Capt. Adames scrivano or purcer
  of our junk retorned from Miaco. And towardes night Capt. Adames fell
  into an extreame fever, with vomiting, and could not make water, soe
  he went to Zanzabars to take phisick. God send him his health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 23.</i>&mdash;Our scrivano of the junck tells me that Ogosho
  Samme sues to the Dyrio<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> to
  have the name of Quambaco,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> which,
  as it should seeme, is as the names of Ceaser or Augustus amongst the
  Emperours of Rome, which is held an honor to all suckceadors. But he

<p>And I delivered or paid to Mr. Wickham in plate of bars, paid per Mr.

<p>Capt. Speck retorned my boy Tome hom, yet wrot me a pricking letter, to

<p>Sugen Donos father sent a present of peares, and envited hym selfe to

<p>Migell <i>jurebassos</i> wife brought me a present of 3 hense, 20 egges,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 27.</i>&mdash;This day at night all the streetes were hanged
  with lantarns, and the pagons vizeted all ther <i>futtaquis</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and
  places of buriall with lantarns and lampes, inviting their dead frendes
  to com and eate with them, and so remeaned till midnight; and then
  each one retorned to ther howses, having left rise, wine, and other
  viands at the graves for dead men to banquet of in their abcense, and
  in their howse made the lyke banquet, leving parte on an altor for
  their dead frendes and kindred. This feast lasteth 3 daies; but to
  morrow is the solomest fast day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 28.</i>&mdash;Our ould <i>jurebasso</i>, Jno. Japon, groing
  in to poverty per his folly and lewd expences, came this day seeking
  new entertaynment; but we had no need of hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 29.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Capt. Adames how his scrivano
  tould me our carpenters said they would not work a stroake on the junk,
  except I gave them a bill of my hand to pay them as they were paid
  the last yeare; which I think is a trampo<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> of
  the Duch to get our carpenters from us to serve their owne turnes,
  they now pretending to set out their rotten junk for to carry provition
  to the Molocas. So I willed Capt. Adames to content them with bill
  or what else, so our busynes may goe forward; and with all advised
  hym that two Englishmen might be spared to assist hym in looking to
  those Japons, we lying 4 or 5 of us idell heare, for that the Worll.
  Company would condem us for lying idell and to suffer strangers to
  look to ther busynes.</p>
<p>And I receved a letter from Capt. Garrocho, of the 2th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> Sept., new stile, wherin he advised me of
  the recept of former matters sent, and to buy hym a jar
  Spanish wyne. Also I receved an other letter from Alvaro
  Monos, with a present of 10 water millons, 10 wreathes
  of bread, and a basket of grapes, with offers of much frendship.</p>
<p>I understand that the Hollanders have offred Damian Marines to goe master
  in their junk for the Molucos; but I know not whether he will accept
  of it or no. But they have emploid hym to provid biskit for them.</p>
<p>And about midnight I had news that an English shipp was on this cost,
  and that 2 daies past she was som 20 Japan leagues from Goto, where
  5 Japans were left abord to pilot her for Firando. So, hereupon, I
  sent out our pinis with Mr. Wm. Eaton in her, the Capt. China accompanying
  hym, to meet them, and sent them 2 barills wyne, 50 loves bread, 2
  hoggs, 12 hense, 2 duckes, 10 water millans, and a baskit of pearse;
  and wrot a letter to Capt. Adames of the newse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 30.</i>&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to advise Semi Dono,
  Taccamon Dono, Oyen Dono, and Gonosque Dono, of the newes our ship
  was without the harbour neare Goto; of which it seemed they were glad,
  and sowne after sent their men to congratulate or rejoyce with me.</p>
<p>And I receved a letter from Jorge Durois, dated in Langasaque, 7th of
  September, new stile, with a jar of conserve of citrones, bought and
  cost 5 <i>taies</i>; also an other jarr conserve which he sent me for
  a present, and 70 candells which cost one <i>taies</i>. And the man
  I sent to buy oyle retorned from Langasaque, and brought but 241 <i>gantes</i> oyle,
  which cost 12&frac12; <i>mas</i> per ten <i>gantes</i>; but could get
  no more at prise, and so retorned the rest money back. Yet Jorge Durois
  writes me a Portingal hath a good quantety to sell. So I must now send
  this foole back againe with the money.</p>
<p>Also I receved a letter from the <i>bongew</i> of Goto, wherin he advised
  me of our ships being neare unto Goto, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> he had put 3 or 4 men in to her to pilot her to Firando.
  And towardes night Capt. Adames wrot me a letter from Cochi how they
  had discovered the shipp to be within 4 leagues, and that he imagined
  she would be at Cochi this tide.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter to Jorge Durois in answer of his rec. this day, willing
  hym to buy me 700 <i>gantes</i> of oyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 31.</i>&mdash;I caused store of boates to goe out to tow in
  our shipp, and wrote a letter to the capt. per Mr. Ed. Sayer, dowbting
  Mr. Eaton hath missed of them. But sowne after our bote retorned and
  the Capt. China in her with a letter from Mr. Eaton, how the ship was
  at an ancor 3 or 4 leagues from Firando, and that the shipps name was
  called the <i>Hoziander</i>, the capt. or Cape merchantes name, Mr.
  Raphe Copingall. So I retorned forthwith per the the said bark and
  went abord, where I receved these letters following, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
      <li>1 generall coppy of a letter from Worshipfull Company.</li>
      <li>1 coppy of theirs in perticuler to Capt. Jurdain, Bantam. </li>
      <li>1 from Capt. Jourden in Bantam, 15th Aprill, 1615. </li>
      <li>1 from Mr. Westbie in Bantam, 10th ditto. </li>
      <li>1 from Jno. Beamond in Bantam, ditto 10th. </li>
      <li>1 from Harnando Ximenes in Bantam, le 9th ditto. </li>
      <li>1 from Mr. Adam Denton in Pattania, le 5th July. </li>
      <li>1 from Generall Saris at Souldania, 1st June, 1614. </li>
      <li>1 from Sr. Thomas Smith in London, 30th November, 1613. </li>
      <li>1 from Sr. Thomas Smith in London, 26th Aprill, 1614. </li>
      <li>1 from my brother Walter Cocks in London, 6th Aprill,
        1614.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Mr. Raphe Copendall came ashore with an other yong man called Jno.
  Osterwick; but the wind was soe extreame that all the barks were forced
  to retorne and leave the shipp riding at ancor.</p>
<p>It apeareth per the Worshipfull Companys letters that all the voyages
  now are put into one generall company in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> adventure. God be praised for it. And as Capt. Copendall
  tells me, their is an other company made to adventure 120,000 <i>l.</i> str.
  per ano. for 4 yeares ensuing, but to what places not openly knowne;
  and that a seale great English shipps weare entred into the straites
  of Magelanus, but for what entent not knowne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 1.</i>&mdash;I rec. a letter from Chubio Dono, wherin he
  wrot me much cumplimento, and sent an other as from the Emperour to
  Capt. Adams, that he should forth with com up to the Emperour. What
  the reason should be I know not; yet I suspect it was a plot laid before
  by Capt. Adames hym selfe and the Duch, to the entent he might goe
  up to serve their turnes; and truly I esteem he loveth them much better
  then us that are of his owne nation; or else it may be that he seeketh
  occation to get the Emperour to comand hym to stay and not to procead
  forward on the Syam voyag, his tyme of service to the Company being
  out within 2 months. Once the end will shew what is the occation. But
  Capt. Adames hym selfe esteemeth it is to enquire of hym about a fortresse
  newly built at the Liqueas, unto which place it was thought Fidaia
  Samme would retire after his losse of Osekey.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck came to English howse, being ready to go up to Miaco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 2.</i>&mdash;I got barks to goe out to tow our shipp into
  harbor, yf it were possible, much fearing a tuffon; and Capt. Copendall
  and Mr. Eaton went aboard to hasten matters forward and, yf the shipp
  came not in, to bring aland our Cambaia cloth and other comodetis,
  to the entent to lay out the present for the Emperor, and make as much
  hast as we can, not to be overlong behinde the Hollanders. But the
  wind proving so hard, we could nether get ship into harbor nor bring
  goods ashore, Capt. Copendall and Mr. Eaton remeanyng all night abord.
  God send us wether to bring her in this dangerous tyme of the yeare.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>We looked out for a bark to goe up in to the Emperour, but could find
  non but ould rotten ons, all being above with the king but one which
  the Hollanders had gotten before we asked. So we sent to Sanguro Dono,
  Foins sonne, som 4 or 5 leagues hence, to borrowe a bark of his.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 3.</i>&mdash;I got barkes to goe out againe to tow ship into
  harbour, yf it remeaned calme, or else to bring good ashore; but the
  wind was so stiffe all day that they could doe nothing.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter to Mr. Jno. Hunt to send his carpenter to tell what
  plank and tymber he needed to sheath and repare the <i>Hoziander</i>;
  and withall sent hym a pig, 6 hense, 10 loves of bread, with peares,
  redish, cowcombers, and bell engenios.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter and sent a present to the <i>bongew</i> of Goto for
  puting pilot abord and sending me word therof. So the present was,
  viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 pec. of white baftas of nyne Rs. <i>corg.</i></li>

    <li>1 pec. blak bafta died, at 9 Rs. <i>corg.</i></li>

    <li>1 pec. duttis of 10 Rs. per <i>corg.</i></li>

    <li>1 pec. blue byram of 10 Rs. per <i>corg.</i></li>

    <li>1 pec. red zelas of 12 Rs. per <i>corg.</i></li>

</ul>
<p>And the master of the bark which brought downe Mr. Eaton came from Langasaque
  and brought me a present of pearse, and offerd to bring his bark hither,
  yf I had need to fraight her. And about mid night Capt. Adams went
  out in a bark abord the <i>Hozeander</i> with many other barks to tow
  her in, we fearing a tuffon. And Capt. Copendall brought 2 bras vessells
  of quicksilver ashore out of the <i>Hozeander</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 4.</i>&mdash;About 9 a clock the <i>Hoziander</i> came to
  an ancor in the harbor of Firando, being towed in with boates, and
  shot ofe ii peces ordinance; and the Duch answered them with two peeces
  out of the howse, and 5 out of the greate ship. And Capt. Speck with
  other merchant came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[
  51]</a></span> abord her, he being ready to departe for Miaco: and
  he presently did, and had 3 peces ordinance for a farewell, and we
  the lyke when we retorned ashore. And they shot 3 peces more after
  out of the Duch howse.</p>
<p>And I made Tushma, my boy, a new <i>kerimon</i> of damask of Canton, with
  a cloake or gaberdyn of stript taffete. And Mr. Nealson paid 3 <i>taies</i> to
  Toma, the boy, and 3 <i>taies</i> to Jno. Moure the boy, upon reconyng
  of ther wages at 1 <i>tay</i> per peece per month. And I delivered
  50 <i>taies</i>, I say 50 <i>taies</i>, plate bars to Mr. Nealson;
  and he paid 10 <i>taies</i> lyke plate to pilottes that brought our
  ship the <i>Hozeander</i> from Goto to Firando. And we receaved ashore
  this day out of the <i>Hoziander</i> 4 chistes guns or fowling peces,
  also two fardelles stile, containing 166 gads,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> with
  4 fardles cloth Choromandell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 5.</i>&mdash;We set carpenters a work to make chistes to
  carry up our goods, and laborers to make mat sackes to put our peper
  in.</p>
<p>Also the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, retorned from Langasaque and brought
  me a present of a blew peece of damask from his brother Capt. Whaw,
  and gave me an other hym selfe with an embrawdred velvet cushin. And
  Jorge Durois sent me 2 hampers containing 5 peces wroght black velvet,
  9 peces black taffeties, and 24 peces sattens, wroght and plane, as
  also three pere silk stockings, and 1 peare thrid as per adviz. And
  Ushenusque Dono, our ould <i>bongew</i>, sent me a present of frute,
  and came hym selfe and viseted me, offring his service to goe up in
  our bark as before, if need weare.</p>
<p>Also we had newse the king of this place was within 13 leagues and would
  be heare to morrow. Yet I was secretly enformed by a frend that he
  is in towne, secretly com in, and ment to retorne out to his barks
  to morrow, and so to enter at pleasure. Soe we gave order to our ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> to sute offe her ordenance as he past by, being determend
  to goe out to meete hym. It is said that the King of Shashma is lykwais
  retorned to his contrey per the Emperours permition; soe it is thought
  som exploit is in hand.</p>
<p>Also the China Capt. tells me that Damian Marin and Jno. de Lievana are
  taken prisoners and carid abord the greate shipp, and is in despite
  of the service they did to the English.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck departed towardes Miaco, and had 2 vollers small shot out
  of the <i>Jaccatra</i> and 5 peces ordinance out of their greate ship,
  and charged againe and gave 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 6.</i>&mdash;We laded most part of our goodes abord a bark,
  to goe for Miaco, Capt. Copingdell going up with Capt. Adames and Mr.
  Wickham. The perticulers goodes appeare per invoiz.</p>
<p>And som 2 howrs before day littell Antony the <i>bongew</i> came and advized
  me how the king was arived, and was glad our English shipp was in saffety
  in the port, and desired that yf we shot offe any ordinance, that it
  might be doone when he was landed or had sett foote ashore.</p>
<p>The botswen, the guner, and the carpenter misused the master, offring
  to have let malefactors out of prison which were punished per the master.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 7.</i>&mdash;Very early in the mornyng the king entred into
  Firando, and the Duch shot ofe 3 small peces ordinance as he passed
  by, out of the howse, and 20 peces ordinance out of the greate ship,
  and 6 out of the small, with 2 volle of small shot out of each ship.
  And our shipp, the <i>Hozeander</i>, shot affe 11 peces ordinance.
  And sowne after I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to Oyen Sono, to desyre
  hym to exskews me towardes the king, for that I came not to kisse his
  handes in respect I thought he was awery of his voyage per sea. He
  said he would adviz the king thereof, and that I had reason in not
  coming, for that he was overweryed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>I delivered 50 <i>taies</i> to Mr. Nealson, and one hundred and fiftie
  to Mr. Wickham in part of his cargezon, and 50 <i>taies</i> to Capten
  Copendall. And Mr. Wickham had a peece fine black taffete, cost me
  29 <i>mas</i>. And Andrea Dittis, the China Capt., brought back a bar
  of Oban gould, sent his brother before to geve to a god child, but
  now retorned, and poz. fyftie and five <i>taies</i>.</p>
<p>And Tono Samme, the king, sent for me to com and speake with hym; which
  I did, accompanid with Capt. Copendall. He tould me that Shongo Samme
  was gon for Edo before he came away, and that he thought the ould Emperour
  was gone for Shrongo before this tyme. Soe he offerd me his letters
  of favour to Codskin Dono and Safian Dono, because (as he said) the
  Spaniardes and Portingals were rejected and not suffred to com in the
  Emperours presence, nether would he vouchsafe to receve any present
  they sent hym. Also he said that he thought this junck which the Hollanders
  had taken was good prise, because they had not the Emperours passe;
  and therefore he would not meddell in the matter.</p>
<p>I could not forget to note downe how Mr. Hunt, the master of the <i>Hozeander</i>,
  fell out with Roland Thomas, the purcer. Soe they went together by
  the eares. I condeme them both very much; but surely they were drunk,
  espetially the master, and I think he is crazed in his witts.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to Gon Rock Dono, how the Portingals had taken Damian
  Marin and Jno. de Lievana prisoners abord there great ship at Langasaque,
  desiring restetution of them, or else I would complaine to the Emperour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 8.</i>&mdash;I delivered 50 <i>taies</i> plate bars to Mr.
  Eaton, and is parte of money sent in cargezon, Mr. Wickham having 150 <i>tais</i> before.
  And I delivered the invoiz or cargezon of goodes sent up into the custody
  of Mr. Ric. Wickham and Mr. Wm. Eaton, to accompany Capt. Raphe Copendall,
  to goe up to the Emperour with a present and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> other goodes to sell, Mr. Wm. Adames accompanying them;
  Mr. Wickham and Miguell <i>jurebasso</i> to goe for Edo, and Mr. Eaton
  and Tome to remeane at Miaco or Osekey. And I would not want to note
  downe that we had much a dow this day about the masters faling out
  with the purcer, all the shipps company being against the purcer; the
  master aledging he followed hym and sett upon hym unawares at advantage,
  and took two gould ringes from hym, and threw hym downe a hill, and
  thowght to have stobd hym with his owne knife, haveing taken it from
  hym per force. Out of dowbt this Roland Thomas is an idell braned foolish
  fellow.</p>
<p>I paid per Co Juan 5 <i>mas</i> for a hat I gave formerly to Sangero Samma,
  ould Foynes sonne, few daies past. And I receved two hundred Rialles
  of eight back from Mr. Wickham of money delivered hym in Syam voyage,
  so that 100 Rs. remeanes yet in his handes.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to Gonrock Dono about the taking prisoners of Damian Marin
  and Jno. de Lievano, desiring hym to procure their liberty, for that
  they belong to our junck, and therefore have nothing to doe nether
  with Spaniard nor Portingall, whom I hould noe justices in Japon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 9.</i>&mdash;I wrot two letters to Jorge Durois and Capt.
  Garrocho, in answer of theirs of the 7th and 12th September, as also
  advising them I would geve knowledg to the Emperour how the Portingalles
  had taken Damian Marin and Jno. de Lievana prisoners, they being our
  servantes, and I had advised the lyke to Gonrock Dono per letter yisterday.
  These 2 letters I sent per conveance of Capt. China. Also I delivered
  one hundred <i>taies</i> plate bars to Mr. Nealson, to lay out for
  the needfull.</p>
<p>The king sent 2 barelles <i>morofack</i>, 6 bundells drid cuttell fish,
  and a hogg, for a present to Capt. Copendall before he went up. And
  Semidone sent to me for a bottell of Spanish wyne, which I sent hym
  out of that littell the Hollanders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> gave me. And Capt. Copendall had 2 pottes of sweet meates
  of ginger, citrons, and oringes, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;Semidone sent for som sweet meates, haveing
  invited the king. Soe I sent hym of 3 severall sortes. Thus these noble
  men use to doe in these partes.</p>
<p>Capt. Copindall had with hym up 2 sivell (<i>sic</i>) spownes, 2 silver
  forkes, and 1 silver salt and cover of Companis, with 2 littell silver
  boles lyke halfe grapes of my owne.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames now came and tould me how we want above 1,000 <i>cattis</i> of
  ould net to calk our junk with all. Out of dowbt his skrivano is a
  false knave; yet I may not say soe to Capt. Adames, for then all the
  fatt would be in the fire.</p>
<p>And ther was 2 baggs peper sould to Skidayn Dono, to pay as rest is sould,
  poz. 131 <i>cattis</i> nett.</p>
<p>I wrot two letters to Jno. de Lievana, 1 per a Japon, and the other enclosed
  to Gonrock Dono, both to one effect, that I will use the best meanes
  I can to procure their libertis, I meane Damian Marins and his, or

  and Mr. Eaton departed from Firando this mornyng towards Miaco; and
  ther was 11 peces ordinance shot affe for a farewell. But, as we were
  at dyner, ther came a letter to me from Capten Copendall, wherin he
  wrot me that Capt. Adames was gon before and would not stay for them,
  and that their bark was so pestred that it was ready to sinck. Whereupon
  he wrot me to send them an other bark to lighten them, which I did
  with all expedition; and per Mr. Rowland Thomas, the bringer of this
  letter, I sent hym, viz., 2 cases bottells of his owne with Spanish
  wyne, 2 barrelles <i>morefack</i>, 40 loves bread, 1 great <i>kitesoll</i>,
  1 bras candellstick. And I wrot an other letter to Capt. Copendall

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> <i>jurebasso</i> had in speeches misused a man of Gonrock
  Donos, whome went passenger in the bark.</p>

  Cop., to passe away the tyme per the way.</p>

  to hym and others which are in place.</p>
<p>And towards night our carpenters that wrought upon the junck came to Firando
  from Cochi, to-morrow being a festivall day, as also to receave more
  rise. I find Gingro, Capt. Adames scrivano, left to look to our workmen,
  to be but an eypleasing prowd knave. They thought to have pickt a quarrell
  to fall out, yet I gave them content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 13.</i>&mdash;Yaimon Dono, the master ship carpenter, brought
  me a present of pears, and, in the end of many complementall speeches,

  of the harbor with nettes and hedges to ketch fish to morrow; and sent
  me word to com and drink with hym to night, which I exskewsed till
  to morrow mornyng.</p>
<p>And towardes night Mr. Jno. Huntt, the master of the <i>Hoziander</i>,
  came and tould me that 2 of the shipps company had byn abcent 2 daies,
  viz., one Doughtie, a quarter master, and an other called Wadden, a
  rich mans sonne of Plymouth, whome is fownd to be a very cheater. And
  at very instant I had notis of Doughtie, where he was drunken in a
  howse; soe I took hym and sent hym abord with a letter to the master,
  etc.</p>
<p>The master sent me word that one Piter Waddon was ashore and had byn the
  lyke 2 daies and nightes together, and that he had stolne and pawnd
  his companions aparell, and laid it to pawne in whorehowses, and was
  gon upon the score in divers howses, and determened to run away to
  som other place. So I laid out to look for hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 15.</i>&mdash;The walle or neting the king caused to be made
  to fish was borne downe in the night with the force of the tide, etc.</p>

  Sayer, Mr. Jno. Osterwick, and Mr. Jones the chirurgion. He entertayned
  us kindly; and so we retorned.</p>
<p>Also we sent 18 <i>piculles cattis</i> net abord the junk at Cochi, with
  iron and sacks charcoll. And there was bought of Andrea, the China
  Capt., and his brother Whaw foure <i>cattis</i> musk, being in 86 codds,
  cost twelve <i>taies</i> per <i>catty</i> in China; and so let us have
  it to pay in Rialles of eight 60 R.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>And I bought and paid for 4 peare lether pomps, and 3 peare velvett pantables<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> two <i>taies</i> to

  the haven at a hie water. I made ready 2 pigs, 2 ducks, 2 hense, and
  a loyne pork, all rosted, with a banket sweetmeates, enviting them
  ashore, but fownd them unwilling; and soe carid it abord the kinges
  boate, where they did eate what they pleased. And soe they departed
  along by our shipp, where they had 7 peces ordinance shot affe at their
  landinge.</p>
<p>And, in my abcense, a fello came with a letter from Jorge Durois and a
  peare silk stocking (as he said); but standing gaping at the fishermen,
  a knave stole both stockinges and letter from hym, or else, as som
  craftie knaves doe, did rob hymselfe, etc.</p>

<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;Taccamon Dono sent me a dish of fresh fish, 1
  of fresh water. The kinges smiths house was set on fyre this night
  by the neglegence of his servantes, but sowne quenched. Yet his dores
  were shutt up by order from the king, because they looked no better
  to matters; it being stricktly looked unto, and they banished or put
  to death that have their howses burned.</p>
<p>In the after nowne the boate I sent to Langasaque, to buy provitions to
  envite the king to dyner, retorned and brought that she went for, with
  2 jarrs conserves from Jorge, brought for me. And Susanna, his wife,
  sent me a box of conserves, with a baskit of peares and an other of
  figges, and a small box of conservs for China Capts. doughter, which
  I sent unto her. Jorge letter was dated in Langasaque le 9th of October,
  new stile, in which he advised me that Damian Marin and Jno. de Lievana
  were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> taken
  prisoners per meanes of Capt. Gorrocho, which truly I doe beleeve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 2.</i>&mdash;Thomas Davis, the carpenter, died this mornyng
  at break of day of the small-pox, he being choaked with them.</p>
<p>I envited the king with his 2 brothers and Nobesane, Semedone, Sangrasame,
  Taccaman Dono, Sugean Dono, and 5 other cavelleros to beare them company
  at the kinges choise. They dyned after the Japan manner, and supped
  after the English. And, as he was at supper, word came that the King
  of Crates was arived; which made hym to make short, and soe went to
  meet hym at landing. Soe the great Holland shipp shot afe 3 peces ordinance
  as he passed by, and the littell shipp 3 other at his landing. Soe
  after he sent me word of his arivall, and envited hym selfe to our <i>fro</i> to
  morrow in the afternowne.</p>
<p>I understood Peter Wadden went 3 tymes over the walle in the night; soe
  I turned hym abord againe. He is a graseles fello and unlykly to amend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 3.</i>&mdash;The King of Firando sent me a buck, knowing the
  King of Crates cam to supper, and gave me many thankes for his kind
  entertaynment yisterday. And after nowne the King of Crates came according
  as he said, being accompanid with the King of Firando and 3 other noble
  men of Crates. Unto whom I gave the best entertaynment I could and
  to their owne contentes. And after, they went abord the great Holland
  shipp, and at retorne ashore had 6 peces ordinance shot out of her
  and 3 peeces out of the littell shipp.</p>
<p>And towardes night 2 Hollander mariners which had comited som falt were
  laid out for having byn abcent 2 or 3 daies from shipp; and 1 of them
  came to the English howse, desiring me on his knees to get his pardon.
  Soe I wrot a word to the capt., and sent our chirurgion along with
  hym. And they were no sooner gon but others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> brought the other Duchman, and he desird the lyke favor
  of me; but, whiles I was writing the letter, he gave them that kept
  hym the slip and soe escaped for the tyme.</p>
<p>The King of Crates gave me a present of 2 <i>langanacks</i><a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and
  a <i>cattan</i>, and desird to see the experience of a fyry arrow shot
  out of a slurbo<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and
  a burnyng pike; which is referd till his retorne from a province of
  his which he is now bownd to vizet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 4.</i>&mdash;The King of Crates departed from Firando this
  mornyng, and the great Holland ship shot afe 3 peeces of ordinance
  as he passed by them.</p>
<p>And I receaved a letter from Ed. Sayer, dated in Langasaque, le 30th of
  Septembr, how he had delivered the present to Gonrock Dono with the
  letters, and that he willed hym to stay 2 daies, and he would use his
  endevor for us in what he could. And I wrot 2 letters to Jorge Durois
  and Capt. Garocho.</p>
<p>And upon councell of frendes, haveing remeander of things bought for inviting
  the 2 kinges, I invited to dyner to morow 9 cavaleros, viz., Gonosco
  Dono, Unagense Dono, Matasabra Dono, Oyen Dono, Toresamon Dono, Soyemon
  Dono, Shosque Dono, Otonagen Dono, Sifian Dono. I had thought to have
  envited Ushenusque Dono, our <i>bongew</i>, and the kinges secretary,
  but they were out of towne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 5.</i>&mdash;The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, retorned to Firando
  from Goto, and brought me back a gould ring, delivered hym the 17th
  September last, to have byn sent for a present to an euenuke in China,
  valued as it cost 5 l. str.; but, upon better consideration, not haveing
  two ringes, and 2 principall men emploied about the affares, they thought
  it best to buy 4 <i>cattans</i> or Japan sables, and to send 2 to eache
  one. Also the China Capt. gave me a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> musk cod for a present, and was sent from a China unknown
  unto me. And he doth assure me on his life that our pretence to gett
  trade into China cannot chuse but com to good effect; which God grant.</p>
<p>The cavaleros envited to dyner came, being 8 in number, as apeareth on
  the other side. And as they were at it, Bongo Sammes adopted sonne
  (which is the kinges youngest brother) came by, and they called hym
  in, and after departed all content.</p>
<p>Gonosquo Dono brought a present of 10 bundells Japan paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 6.</i>&mdash;We bought our next neighbors <i>chowne</i>, or
  howse place, to the northwardes, to pay 40 <i>tais</i> for it, and
  she to carry away the howse, but geve it out we pay but 25 taies for
  it, she being far in debt and therfore the money seazed upon. The other
  15 <i>taies</i> she hath secretly, to mentayn her and her children.
  Also Mr. Nealson paid the scrivano of the junk 60 <i>taies</i> 4 <i>mas</i> plate
  bars, for to pay carpenters and mareners; and sent 150 bags lyme to
  Cochi. And I delivered 40 R. 8 to China Capt. to buy, or rather garnish,
  4 <i>cattans</i>, to send into China. Allso I delivered hym 4 <i>mas</i> wight
  Priaman gould for same purpose.</p>
<p>And I delivered one hundred <i>taies</i> plate bars to Mr. Nealson. Also
  Mr. Nealson paid sixteen <i>taies</i> plate to China Capt., viz., 12 <i>taies</i> in
  bars for blads, and 4 <i>taies</i> in small plate of workmanshipp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 7.</i>&mdash;The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, came and tould
  me that the capt. moure<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> of
  the shipp of Amacon and other Spaniardes and Portingales had hired
  2 barkes for 100 <i>taies</i>, to com from Langasaque to Firando, to
  use meanes to steale away a Portingall which is capt. of the junk the
  Hollanders took; and that ther was divers Spaniardes and Portingalls
  armed secretly in the said barkes, which matter was revealed by 3 Chinas
  which fled out of the said junk to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> Langasaque and made report hereof to other Chinas, 1
  of whome wrot therof to the China Capt. So I went to the Duch howse
  and made it knowne to the Hollanders, whoe gave me harty thankes for
  it.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter to our host at Tushma, per a merchant of that place,
  desyring to heare from hym of sale of our pepper, which I understand
  was soald long since; and that upon his advise I would send more, desyring
  hym to bring or send the money for this per first sure conveance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 8.</i>&mdash;This day, before nowne, our 3 barks we sent to
  Osekay with Capt. Copendall and his company retorned, from whome I
  receaved a letter, dated in Osekay the 23th ultimo, with an other of
  same date from Mr. Eaton, wherin they adviz me the Emperour was departed
  from Miaco 8 daies before their arivall, and that Capt. Adames went
  post after hym, being geven to understand that he ment to stay in a
  place at halfe way, hoping by this meanes to dispach busynes theare,
  and so to retorne; the Duch haveing dispached theirs before he went
  from Miaco. And they thought it fitt to retorne back all 3 barks, because
  they knew not how long it wold be before they retorned. Also they both
  writ me that pack no. 116 is wanting in the cargezon, with 5 bambows
  black paynting and 5 small pec. wax.</p>
<p>Also our host of Sackay came to Firando and brought me a present of a
  barrell of wyne, making much mone that all he had was burned when our
  comodeties were burned, so that now he is new to enter into the world,
  and to that entent meanes to goe purcer in a junk of Gonrock Donos
  for Syam.</p>
<p>I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to thank Songero Samme and Sifian Dono for
  the lent of their barks to carry up our men and merchandiez. Capt.
  Copendall advized me he gave 2 <i>taies</i> to the master of the greate
  bark and 1 <i>tay</i> to the purcer. And ther was geven away in presents
  as followeth, viz.: To Gonosqo Dono, governor, 1 pec. black satten,
  cost 6<i>ta</i>; 3
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> pec. whit baftas of 8 R. corg; 5 knives. To Shosqo Dono,
  the kings chamberlen, 1 pec. alleias of 15 R. per <i>corg</i>; 3 pec.
  baftas of 8 R. per <i>corge</i>, 3 pec tapis Suras. To Unagense Dono,
  capt. generall, 1 damask peec. To Skiamon Dono, provedore, 1 pec. alleias
  of 15 R. per <i>corge</i>; 1 pec. white baftas of 8 R. per <i>corge</i>;
  1 pec. duble borall<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> of

  ould cooke, 1 peec. white bafta of 8 Rs. per <i>corge</i>. To 5 neighbours
  maid servantes for cookry, 3 duble peeces of burrall of 7 Rs. <i>corg</i>.</p>
<p>I receaved a letter from Ed. Sayer, dated 6 days past, wherin he wrote
  me Gonrock Dono drivs hym of with delaies, and as yet hath not sett
  the men at liberty, but rather that the Portingals have put Jno. de
  Lievana in irons beloe in the shipp, as well as Damian, for that no
  man should com to speake with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 9.</i>&mdash;We searched our warehouse for pack no. 116, but
  canot find it; and examening over packing bill and wast book, find
  that the said pack with the wax and 5 bambows painting were all sent
  along in the great bark of Sangero Samma; soe it must rest upon the
  master, the purcer, and upon Jno. Pheby to answer for those matters.</p>
<p>Ed. Sayer retorned from Langasaque and brought answer from Gonrock Dono
  that he had donne what possibly he could, but could not get the 2 men
  set at liberty. So I went and tould the king thereof, and tould hym
  I ment to send away a bark in all hast with letters to Capt. Adames
  to adviz the Emperour thereof, desiring to have his Highnes letters
  of favor of the matter, which he promised me. So I made ready the bark
  and wrot my letters: a generall letter to Capt. Adames, Mr. Eaton,
  and Mr. Wickham, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> apeareth per copy, but antedated to morow; and also
  a letter to Capt. Copendall, advizing of losse of pack no. 116 with
  wax and paynting; and at any hand advised Capt. Adames to use all meanes
  possible to set these two men at liberty.</p>
<p>Gonrock Dono sent me a present per his man of a peare <i>bubes</i><a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and
  2 chist <i>mach</i>,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> containing
  in each chist 200 roles cotton <i>mach</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 10.</i>&mdash;As I was about to send away the bark and sent
  to the king for his letters, he retorned me word that he had taken
  counsell about the matter, and wished me once more to stay a littell
  and he would send 1 of his owne men to Gonrock Dono, not dowbting but
  to procure the men to be set at liberty. So, much against my will,
  I was constrained to desist from my purpose.</p>
<p>I forgot to set downe how I receaved a letter from Martin de Guinia, the
  capt. of Amacan shipp, with an other from Capt. Garocho, and a therd
  from Jorge Durois, all dated le 15th present, new stile, and a forth
  letter from Albaro Munos, of 17th ditto. And Jorge Durois sent me 2
  pear of silk stockinges, cost, as he said, 7 <i>taies</i>, with 100
  candells at 7&frac12; for a <i>mas</i>. Also I receaved a fifte letter
  from Melchar van Sanfort, dated in Langasaque, le 12th currant, new
  stile, only of commendacons; and he retorned me a Duch cronocle which
  I lent hym. And ther was a bag of Pattania pepper sould to Gonrock
  Dono for the Emperour, containing grose 160 <i>cattis</i>, is net 155 <i>cattis</i>,
  at 8 <i>tais</i> per <i>picull</i>.</p>
<p>And about one a clock after midnight Tho. Heath, the carpenters mate of
  ye <i>Hozeander</i>, dyed of a lingaring disease, which began with
  a blody flux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 11.</i>&mdash;Our junck, the <i>Sea Adventure</i>, was lanched
  this day at Cochi, and I got Mr. Hunt to goe see her yf the carpenters
  had donne their partes, Ed. Sayer accompanyng
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> hym. I sent the letters I wrot of 10th current to Mr.
  Eaton per a bark of Firando, and put 5 <i>mas</i> port on it, and in
  that letter 2 others for Capt. Copindall, 1 from Mr. (<i>sic</i>) and
  an other from Mr. Osterwick, and a therd from my selfe, dated as to
  morow, le 12th present, advising with all speed to send them to Capt.
  Adames to speak to the Emperour to procure the liberty of Damian and
  Jno. Also I sent an other letter to Mr. Eaton, to enquir whether Twan
  is apointed to make warse against the Chinas, and to send me word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 12.</i>&mdash;I forgot to note downe yisterday that, when the
  ships company went to bury Thomas Heath in the place where they formerly
  had buried his mate, Tho. Davies, they fownd that som villanouse people
  had diged up the cooffin and stolne the winding sheete and his shert,
  and lefte the karkasse naked upon the grownd&mdash;a villanouse acte.
  So they soonke the other coffin into the sea.</p>
<p>The kinges eldest brother, Guenche Samme, <i>alius</i> Tonoman Samme,
  had 20 <i>cattis</i> wax, to pay as the rest is sould.</p>
<p>14 of the junks carpenters began to work upon the <i>Hozeander</i> this
  mornyng, counting the master for one, all ship carpenters.</p>
<p>I had much adow this day about a boy which Mr. John Osterwick had entertayned,
  named Antony, whome (as it seemeth) is servant to a Spaniard that sent
  a Japon into our howse, a mallapert knave, whoe, without speaking a
  word unto me nor no man else, went up into Mr. Osterwicks chamber and
  laid handes on the boy to have throwne hym out of the howse per force;
  yet he went without hym. But sowne after the King of Firando sent me
  word to deliver the boye into his handes, which I did, he promising
  to send a man with hym that yf in case it be a false bravado of the
  Spaniardes (as I aleadge it is) that then the boy may be retorned back,
  etc.</p>
<p>Also the master, Jno. Hunt, and Mr. Osterwick, going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> a lodg the king had lent as, fownd a yong
  gerle of som 11 or 12 years of adge, dead on the back side
  under the walle, and doggs feeding on her, havinge eaten
  both her legges and her lower partes, with one hand, being
  newly kild but a littell before. It is thought som villen
  had ravished her and after kild her, or else, being a slave,
  her master had kild her upon som displeasure and cast her
  out to be eaten of dogges, an ordenary matter in these
  partes, the lives of all slaves being in the masters handes,
  to kill them when he will, without controle of any justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 13.</i>&mdash;This night past, about midnight, our small skiffe
  of the <i>Hoziander</i> was stolne away and, as the shipps company
  sayeth, per a Hollander which ran away from the great shipp, being
  one of the two I wrot in favour of heretofore, and that they saw hym
  upon our bridg in the night about midnight; so out of dowbt I think
  they let hym goe away with the boate, one knave helping or winking
  at an others escape. For truly I neaver saw a more froward and bad
  leawd company then most of them are, and the cheefe ringleader a master
  mate called Dorington. So that, seeing contynewally their leawd courses
  in going abroad night and day without leave, the offecers them selves
  being worst of all, we were forsed to make orders and set them up at
  meane mast, sortinge the company into therds, one whereof might take
  their pleasure per day, retorning abord before sonne setting, and the
  other &#8532; to look to shipps busynes and that carpenters doe their
  labour. This Dorington hath said in open company amongst them all that
  nether captain, master, nor no other had authority to punish men with
  ducking nor whiping, geving it out with othes that he and the rest
  would have victuels as they list, without controle. Once he is a drunken,
  unruly, mutenouse fello, and not fitt to serve the Wor<sup>ll</sup> Company.</p>
<p>I sent word to the Duch howse how that fello had stolne away our skiffe;
  as also I sent word of the lyke to Taccama
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> Samme and the admerall, whoe have sent to look out after
  hym.</p>
<p>The China Capt. brought me word that all Goto is burned, the kinges howse
  as well as rest, not one howse left standing of some 300. It is thought
  the Japans sett it on fyre of purpose to have the riffling of the Chinas
  goods which came in 7 or 8 junks, but the fyre was so vehement that
  littell or nothing was saved, 5 Chinas being burned that adventured
  to save their goods.</p>
<p>And in the after nowne the kings man, which he sent to Langasaque about
  the setting of Damian and Jno. at liberty, retorned with a sleevles
  answer, they Portingales answering, as they did before, that they would
  not deliver them upon noe tearmes. And on the way, as the kings man
  retorned, som 7 leagues from Firando, he met the Duch man which had
  stolne our skiffe, and so brought both hym and it back againe. Soe
  I sent the Duchman to the Hollands howse, for which they gave me many
  thanks.</p>
<p>I went to the king to certefy hym, or rather to know of hym, what answer
  he had receavd from Gonrock Dono; which was as I said before. Whereupon
  I desird his Highnesse to lett me have his letters of favour to Safian
  Dono and to Gota Zazabra, testefying how these 2 men were entertayned
  into the service of Englishmen to goe in our junck for Syam; which
  letters the king granted me and sowne after sent them for the English
  howse. And I wrot an other to Chubio Dono, in the Japan tonge, to desire
  his assistance in this matter to the Emperour, to get these 2 men sett
  free. So we hird a light bark which rowed with 4 ores and a fellow
  to cary those letters, and paid 12 taies small plat for the voyag,
  to deliver the letters to Mr. Wm. Eaton at Osekay, or Miaco; in doing
  whereof they are to rowe night and day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 14.</i>&mdash;I sent away the kinges letters and wrot a generall
  letter to Capt. Adames, Mr. Wickham, and Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> Eaton, and sent it per light horsman as before, advising
  at large, as I did in my former letters 2 daies past. And I sent out
  6 barkes to tow in our junck from Cochi, which brought her into harbour
  at Firando about nowne.</p>
<p>I delivered back the writing I had of Capt. Whaw for 550 <i>pezos</i> adventured
  to China the yeare past. I delivered it back to his brother Andrea.
  And ther was five <i>piculles</i> Bantam pepper sould to Tomo Dono,
  to pay as we sell the rest.</p>
<p>Two Caffros of the King came from Langasaque and advised me that an English
  gentleman was kept captive in cheanes abord the ship of Amacan, and
  that they saw hym, he being a young man of 24 or 25 yeares of adge.
  But I did enter into opinion that this might be som trap of the Portingals
  and Spaniardes to make me to write to the Emperour upon such a slight
  speech without other proofe, whereby to geve the Emperour distast,
  ther being no such matter at all. Yet I have geven order to frendes
  that may goe abord the said shipp, to look out whether ther be any
  such matter or no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 15.</i>&mdash;In this burnyng of Goto the post, or man which
  carid the kinges letters, lost all that he had, to the vallue of 700 <i>taies</i>,
  being an ould man but well spoaken and therfore chosen to goe about
  this busynes. Whereupon the China Capt. said unto me that out of his
  owne he would send hym 50 <i>pezos</i>, is forty <i>taies</i>, and
  wished me to ad 20 <i>pezos</i> more to it, to make it up 70 <i>pezos</i>,
  and that he would send it all to hym in my name, as a largesse in respeckt
  of his losse, being sorry for it, promising greater matters, yf yt
  pleased God to prosper hym in his proceadinges to get us trade into
  China.</p>
<p>And ther was sent 2 presentes to Whaw, the China Capt. brother, and an
  other China of Langasaque called Leangu, I say Leangu, both which are
  emploid about our busynes to procure trade into China, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>November 3.</i>&mdash;The king of Firando banished on of our marenars
  of our junck, because Takcamon Dono had banished a yong gentelman for
  geving hym a cut with a <i>cattan</i>. So the gentelman was recalled

  was cut in peeces for thefte.</p>

  it per first junk which goeth from thence, advising Mr. Gurney, or
  any other in his place, to provid lading in tyme, knowing before of
  her coming. Also I wrot 2 letters, per Capt. China conveance, to the
  said Melchar to buy 8000 neales, and to Jorge Durois to buy 5 or 6 <i>piculls</i> rosen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 8.</i>&mdash;I receved a lettr from Jorge Durois, dated in
  Langasaque, le 14th of Novembr, new stile, wherin he wrot that the
  king of Shashma was making ready 400 barkes of warr with all hast,
  but for what purpose it is not knowne; and that the Emperour had sumond
  all the kinges or <i>tonos</i> in Japon to be at Shrongo in the moneth
  of Marche next.</p>
<p>He wrot me of pitch he would buy at Langasaque at 3&frac12; <i>taies</i> per <i>picull</i>.</p>
<p>A Japon called Martin, which Mr. Wickham imploied at Liqueas when he put
  Jno. Japon away, did steale a <i>wacadash</i> or dagger with 10 <i>gocos</i> or
  dishes, and being taken was condemned to be cut in peces. Yet the kinge
  saved his lyfe in respect he was of Langasaque, but banished out of

  againe.</p>

<p><i>November 9.</i>&mdash;The Portuguese, that was capt. of the junck which
  the Hollanders took, escaped againe out of the shipp <i>Ankewsen</i> with
  fetters on his legges, and, as it is thought, could not be donne but
  the wache must know thereof.</p>
<p>Yt was not the Portingale capt. which escaped, but 10 other slaves, Chinas
  and Caffros, which did belong to the junck.</p>
<p>Gonrok Dono wrot the King of Firando that he had donne what he could to
  set Damian and Jno. at libertie, but that the capt. would doe nothing;
  yet, before the shipp went out, he would goe and fetch hym out hym
  selfe. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[
  83]</a></span> is Gon Rock Donos suttiltie, because he now understandeth
  the Emperour hath geven order to sett them at liberty; otherwaies he
  had rather they were hanged, to have Damians goods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 10.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. receaved a letter from his brother
  in Langasaque, of a China junck (or <i>soma</i>) which departed from
  thence for China with 77 or 78 men in her, but were met by theevs at
  sea, who cutt all their throtes and carid away all that was good, and
  soe the junk was driven upon the cost of Goto with 7 or 8 dead men
  in her, the rest being throwne over board.</p>
<p>Gorezon, our <i>jurebasso</i>, pad Pedro five <i>mas</i> on my acco. to
  buy hym shewes. Oto, Mat[ingas] slave, ran away; but her surties brought
  her back againe. I enquired wherfore she ran away, and she answered
  because she wanted occupiing and that she could not endure it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 11.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. receaved a letter from his brother
  to buy 200 peeces dutts of us and he would send money for them, and
  buy them to geve to pore Chinas, to clothe them, that were in two junks
  which were cast away, one on the Liqueas and the other on cost Shashma,
  som being drowned, and them which escaped were stark naked. He tells
  me they will geve these duttis to these Chinas, which dwell most of
  them neare Lanquin, and tell them it was the gift of the English, because
  they should speake well of our nation in respeck of the matter they
  have in hand to procure trade into China. They must pay a <i>tay</i> per
  pece for these duttis.</p>
<p>And we receaved a rest of a barell gunpoulder, very bad, which remened
  in Zanzabars howse, and put it into our new lodg. Also Mr. Nealson

  Do[no] said that yf the men were not sett at libertye upon
  sight of his letter, that then I should advise hym thereof,
  and he would use other meanes. So the king tould me he
  would send to Gonrock Dono, to know whether they would
  set them at liberty or no. Gonrok Donos man came to viset
  me, yet willed me I should not say he was heare. There
  is duble dealing with them.</p>

  snaphanne fowling peeces, to send to Safian Dono for the Emperour.

  lead stolne out of the <i>Hozeander</i> the night past, out of guners
  cabben, which were the covers for the tucholes of great ordinance and

  humor), yet I laid hands upon this fellow and brought hym before the

  be aledged against hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 26.</i>&mdash;The king sent for a bottell Spanish wyne, and
  desird to buy Mr. Osterwickes cloake, being of culler du roy, which
  he sent unto hym at price of 20 <i>taies</i>. And, as I am enformed,
  the Portingall capt. is escaped out of the great Holland shipp, swyming
  abord to 4 barks which had layne secretly attending for hym this monthe;
  for which it is said Capt. Speck is much offended with Derrick de Vris,
  the master.</p>

  other thinges in it, to the vallew of 20 <i>taies</i>, is lykewaies
  lost in same bark, or else the one nor other was never put into it.</p>

  as Damian tells me, they had condemned them both to die the death,
  and sent hym word to confesse hym and make hym selfe ready, for dye
  he must. This passed some moneth agoe, he looking still when he should
  die, till the instant they set them at liberty. And then the capt.
  thought to have perswaded hym to have gon along with hym, promising
  hym mountaynes, and, when he could not preveale, procured hym to sweare
  he should not goe with the English nor Hollanders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 1.</i>&mdash;I receaved back from Capt. Coppendall the sylver
  salt, the 2 spoones, and 2 forkes of silver, lent hym up, with the
  2 littell silver cups or tasters I lent hym. Also he gave me a present

  but the Castillanos; in fyne, they are all our enymies, deadly yf it
  la in their powers. I was advised he hath byn 8 or 10 daies in towne,

  Adames and Ed. Sayer: the first letter to Bantam sent per the ship <i>Ankewsen</i>,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 22.</i>&mdash;About breake of day the Hollanders discharged
  much ordinance and small shott, it being their new yeares day. The
  Duch junck that they took prize went out of rode of Firando towardes
  Syam this day before nowne. And I wrot 2 letters to Mr. Wickham and
  Mr. Eaton, dated the 18 and 20th present, but kept till this day, and

  master in answer of recept of his per Capt. Adames and seting free

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 23.</i>&mdash;This day a boy of 16 yeares ould was cut in
  peeces for stealing a littell boate and carying it to an other iland.
  I sent to the kyng to beg his lyfe, which he granted me, and in the
  meane tyme sent a man after the execusoner to stay a lyttell; but he
  would not, but put hym to death before the pardon came, cuting hym
  in many mammocks to try their <i>cattans</i> upon hym.</p>
<p>I sent Piter Wadden out to Cochi, with a barill wyne, 10 loves of bread,
  and a baskit of oranges, to Piter Johnson, master of the junck which
  goeth to Syam, which stayeth there to make acco. with Japonnars about
  the reparing of her, the Hollanders haveing emploid a knave about it
  which hath deceaved them, as Capt. Adames scrivano hath donne us, and
  carid 50 <i>taies</i> with hym which was paid the carpenters upon acco.
  of <i>Hozeander</i>, and receaved the full payment of junck besids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 24.</i>&mdash;Our carpenters came and tould me that yf they
  might not have the 50 <i>taies</i> paid them which Mr. Nealson paid
  the scrivano of junck, or rather the scrivano deseaved the carpenters
  and tould them it was of the junckes acco., when the truth is it was
  of shipps. Soe we are forced to pay this 50 <i>tais</i> againe and
  keepe it upon acco. till the junk retorne.</p>
<p>There came 3 Spaniardes to our English house, which were of the shipp
  which came from Aguapulca. They tould me it was true that 7 or 8 shipps
  were in the S. say, and had donne som hurt one the cost of Peru, so
  that all was up in armes; and that the Spaniardes in New Spaine had
  made proclemacon, in payne of death, that all strangers were to avoid
  out of New Spaine and never retorne to trade theare any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 25.</i>&mdash;Chrismas Day. Taccamon Dono sent 2 barilles
  wyne and 2 fishes for a present; the king 2 pec. wale fyshe; the China
  Capt. a jarr of China wine; and other neighbors other trifles per reason
  of Chrismas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 26.</i>&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to thank the king
  and Takamon Dono for the presents they sent, according to Japon order.</p>
<p>The Hollanders had a demi cannon of bras cast this day, po. 5,000 wight,
  a very fayre peece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 27.</i>&mdash;Towardes night Soyemon Dono, the kinges steward,
  came to English howse, taking it in his way (as he said) going to the
  king. The China Capt. met hym. And his errand was about the money the
  king oweth the Wor. Company, which, as he sayeth, the king will now
  pay in, and take up comodeties of us to pay next yeare at a resonable
  rate, as the Duch have geven it hym, whoe have now sould hym upon trust
  for 10,000 <i>taies</i>. The king, he saieth, taketh this course by
  littell and littell to bring hym selfe out of debt, which his granfather
  left hym to pay, and so, once getting an even hand, will so hould hym.
  The merchandiz he taketh up he geveth to Japons at Miaco, of whome
  Foyne Samme took up money in tymes past, which still runeth on at intrest,
  and yf it should so contynew would undo hym. So I referd this matter
  ofe till to morrow, because I would take counsell, and in the meane
  tyme desird him [to say] I was as willing as Capt. Speck to doe the
  king any service I could.</p>
<p>Nicolas Grant, a marener, being drunk, stabd hym selfe thorow the arme,
  because Mr. Osterwick would not lend hym 12<i>d.</i>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 28.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. built or reard a new howse this
  day, and all the neighbours sent hym presentes, <i>nifon cantange</i>.
  So I sent hym a barill <i>morofack</i>, 2 bottells Spanish wine, a
  drid salmon, and halfe a Hollands cheese; and after, went my selfe
  with the nighbours. Where I saw the seremony was used, the master carpenter
  of the kinge doing it, and was as followeth: First they brought in
  all the presentes sent and sett them in ranke before the middell post
  of the howse, and out of eache one took something of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> the best and offred it at the foote of the post, and
  powred wyne upon each severall parcell, doing it in greate humilletie
  and silence, not soe much as a word spoaken all the while it was a
  doing. But, being ended, they took the remeander of the presentes,
  and soe did eate and drink it with much merth and jesting, drinking
  themselves drunken all or the most parte. They tould me they beleeved
  that a new howse, being hallowed in this sort, could not chuse but
  be happie to hym which dwelled in it, for soe their law taught them,
  ordayned by holy men in tymes past.</p>
<p>The shipps company came to the English howse in a maske, and after plaied
  Christmas ule games in good sort and meryment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 29.</i>&mdash;I gave Matinga a pece satten, cost 5 <i>taies</i>,
  and a peece of taffety, cost 1 <i>tay</i>, to make her a <i>kerremon</i>,
  and 2 <i>kerremons</i> of zelas to Oto and Fuco. And ther was sould
  and deliverd 10 <i>cattis</i> Priaman pepper to the kinges doctor of
  phisick, rated at 8 <i>condrins</i> per <i>catty</i>, or 8 taies <i>picull</i>.</p>
<p>And I thought good to note downe how Mr. Hunt, the master, came in a fume
  ashore, and broake Jno. Cocora the cooks head, at instigation of Jno.
  Shipperd, he having first misuesed and beaten hym without reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 30.</i>&mdash;We bought 732 bags white lyme at 3 <i>condrins</i> per
  bagg, it being good cheape. And I wrot a letter to Jorge Durois to
  look out for <i>morofack</i> and cows shewet for shipps use for chirurgion.
  God send health.</p>
<p>A China of Lankyn brought me a present of a barill of Lankyn wyne and
  a dozen of China cakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 31.</i>&mdash;I paid therty <i>taies</i> for a howse for Matinga,
  that shee was in being for the Company.</p>
<p>And the Japon barber Rappado sent me a present of a basket of oringese.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how I wrot a few lynes to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> Jno. Hunt, to have had hym com ashore about
  Compa. busynes, to have had his advice about bras shivers;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> but
  he retorned me a snapish answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 1, 1615[6].</i>&mdash;Mr.
  Hunt, the master of the <i>Hozeander</i>, remenyng still in his extreme
  humours (as I have fownd hym allwaies the same man ever since he came
  into Japon), wrot a letter to Capt. Coppendall, he being sick in bed
  (as he hath byn most an end ever since he retorned from Miaco), and
  I verely think that the unruly company of the shipp to be the cheefe
  occation&mdash;I say he advised Capt. Coppendall he would com ashore
  to morrow and geve direction how to cast bras shivars and shot for
  ordinance, aledging the guner knew nothing for shott, nor no man else
  but hym selfe for the rest. Yet, for my parte, I rest dowbtfull whether
  it be soe or noe, only I wrot hym before in frendly sort to com ashore
  and assist me in these matters for the service of the Wor. Company,
  our emploiers, because the Duch sent away shipp after ship yerly full
  laden with shot, powlder, ordinance, victuells, and munision, and I
  would in som sort geve a reason or tast to our emploiers of these matters
  and send them samples with price. But, as it should seeme, the master
  disenableth all but hymselfe, and others hould back, I know not whether
  upon sutteltie to leave the other in lurch, as debasing all but hym
  selfe. But be it the one or other, the Companies busynes rests undon,
  etc., and the very truth is, here doe I confes before God and the world,
  I never did see a more unruly compa. of people, and are far worse then
  they in the <i>Clove</i>, allthough they were bad enough.</p>
<p>And yisternight, very late, came on Jno. Shippard, a tapstar as I understand,
  and in very deed a shuffling fello, not worthy water for his hier.
  He is a turbulent fello, a make bate, and sett the master at odds with
  others per meanes of his smouthe tong, and yet a drunken fello, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> most of the rest are the lyke; and came againe into
  the kitchin to quarrell with our cooke at supper tyme, I desyring Mr.
  Osterwick to put hym out of the howse and send hym abord the shipp;
  but he fell upon Mr. Osterwick, and puld his clothes afe his back,
  and misused hym, for which I put hym in the bilboes to cowle his feete
  till mornyng.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 2.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Jorge Durois to buy 100 or
  200 tallo candelles and bring them with hym. And Matinga went into
  her new howse this day. And Gorezan, our <i>jurebasso</i>, removed
  his howse, and came with wife and famely and dwelt in the Companis
  howse over the way, to keepe the shopp or shew rowme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 3.</i>&mdash;This mornyng very cold wether, being a greate
  snowe, the greatest I saw since our arivall in Japon, with a stiffe
  gale wind northerly, rack from W. all day, and snow per fitts all day,
  but littell or non per night. The King of Firandos host at Osekay came
  againe and brought a present of figges, telling me he was to retorne
  to his howse, the king haveing rewarded hym well, as all the caveleros
  in his kingdom did the lyke, towardes the setting him up a new howse,
  his ould being burned in the wars with all that ever he had. Soe, with
  consent of Capt. Coppendall and the rest, ther was a bar of plate of
  4&frac12; <i>taies</i> and a bag of rise of 51 <i>gantes</i> geven
  hym and sent after hym to his lodging.</p>
<p>There was delivered to the fownder for formes as followeth: 1 bras shiver
  of the boate; 1 rownd shot of saker; 1 langrell shot of saker; 1 crosbar
  shot of minion; 5 braz of severall sortes&mdash;to make others by.
  And I agreed with hym as followeth: to make 5 greate bras shivers of
  35 or 86 <i>cattes</i> per shiver; 5 others of a lesser sise: 3 others
  of sise of that of boate; 2 others of bigger sise; 1 quintall bras
  of severall sortes&mdash;and to pay 12 <i>taies</i> per <i>pico</i> for
  all, on with an other, ready made, the fownder finding all stuffe.
  Also 100 saker shott, &frac12; round and other &frac12; crosbar; 100
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> minion shot, &frac12; rownd and other &frac12; crosbar;
  50 saker langrell shott, all iron&mdash;price made at 14 <i>mas</i> per <i>pico</i> or
  100 wight Japon. I was forsed to put out these at hazard per ould shott
  and shivers, the master, Jno. Hunt, not coming to geve direction, nether
  at my request and writing, nor at sending for of Capt. Coppendall,
  refusing ever to enter againe into the English howse. I could say much
  of this frantick master, Jno. Hunt; but I leve it to other men to tell.</p>
<p>Also the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, had a littell brod cloth, pink culler,
  to make his littell doughter a peare of stockinges or bowtes this cold
  wether.</p>
<p>And there was 3 sackes rise, of 50 <i>gantes</i> per sack, geven to 3
  pore Chinas which lost their junck per tempest of the cost of Shashma
  and came to the China Capt. for releefe, he geveing eche of them a
  sack rise and a <i>tay</i> in plate. And upon good consideracion I
  gave them, per generall consent, each one a sack, as above said.</p>
<p>Mr. Dorington late at night came to the English howse, and tould me the
  master sent hym to tell me the mast was wolled,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and
  ready to bring ship to a caryne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 4.</i>&mdash;I went to the Duch howse and desired Capt. Speck
  to send us his helpe and people to bring our shipp to a caryn, as formerly
  in frenshipp they had promised us; which in good sort he assented unto,
  and sent for the masters of the great shipp and junck and willed them
  and the rest to aide us in what they might. These men came at Capt.
  Specks first sending for, and did what he ordayned, but Mr. Hunt sent
  me word he would never com in the English howse, upon a lunetike humour,
  which each man telleth me is his condition not only heare, but at Pattania
  and elsewhere hath donne the lyke. Soe I went abord and saw them turne
  up the ships keele, but water came in so fast at port holes and else
  where that they were forced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> right her againe to cawke her better. I tould Mr. Hunt
  I was com to vizet hym abord, althoughe he sent me word he would not
  com ashore, yet willed hym hereafter to com when I sent for hym, or
  else I would fetch hym. Also I willed hym to send Jno. Shepperd ashore
  to dresse the Companies meate; which he denyed at first, but after
  sent hym.</p>
<p>And Zanzabar, <i>allius</i> Yasimon Dono, came to vizet me at English
  howse, and brought me a present of oringes and a barrill of wine, and
  sent 2 men to helpe to bring downe the shipp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 5.</i>&mdash;Zanzabers littell doughter came to vizet me, and
  brought a present of wyne, orenges, eggs, and fysh drest. And an ould
  man of Miaco, now our neighbour, brought me a banketting box for a
  present. His name is Ito Yoguiche Dono.</p>
<p>Sangero Samme, sonne to Foyne Samme, was this day made sure to a doughter
  of a noble man of Crates.</p>
<p>Their was 210 <i>cattis</i> ould junk or rops put out to toose<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> for
  occom, wherof 50 <i>cattis</i> to Domingo, and 160 <i>cattis</i> to
  Unquan the China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 6.</i>&mdash;Sugen Dono of Crates sent to borrow a peare of <i>bubes</i>,
  he haveing invited the King of Firando to dyner, in respect he had
  geven or augmented his yearly stipend from 500 <i>gocos</i> per anno.
  to 1000 per anno.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck came to the English howse with Derick de Vryz and others to
  take leave, the great shipp being ready, as they said, to goe out.
  They had byn with the kyng before they came to us, and, as it seemed,
  had drunk hard. It is said they gave a present worth 5000 <i>taies</i> to
  the kinge, but I canot beleeve it. Once they have geven much in respect
  of the prize they brought in, as also for lycence to carry out munision,
  victuelles, and men for the Molucos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 7.</i>&mdash;The greate Duch shipp, called the <i>Ankewsen</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> went out to Cochi, and I went abord with
  our bark with 16 men, to rowe and helpe to toe them out,
  as the king sent many barks to doe the lyke; and I carid
  2 barilles wyne, 3 hense, 2 duckes, 3 fyshes, 20 loves
  fresh bread, and a baskit of oringes, and dronke to their
  good voyage; which Capt. Speck tooke in good parte, and
  sent his <i>jurebasso</i> with complemento, <i>nifon catange</i>.</p>
<p>Zanzebars wives brothers and her father were abord, and made peace with
  Jno. Gorezano, our <i>jurebasso</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 8.</i>&mdash;We had made price before with Andrea Dittis for
  all our lead at 6 <i>taies</i> per <i>pico</i>; but now a Japon offring
  us 6&frac12; <i>taies</i> per <i>pico</i>, he was content to let us
  sell hym the one halfe.</p>
<p>Also I receaved 3 letters from Langasaque, 1 from Jorge Durois with 16
  falling bands at 7 <i>mas</i> per band. And an ould China brought me
  a present of China cakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 9.</i>&mdash;This last night, about 10 a clock, 4 Portingale
  prisoners ran away out of the Duch howse and are scaped and thought
  got to Langasaque.</p>
<p>Yasimon Dono advised me of a man of his com from Miaco, who reporteth
  of very fowle wether above, and that 70 or 80 barks are cast away per
  meanes therof. God send us good news of ours sent to Osekay and Tushma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 10.</i>&mdash;Three of the Portingales which ran away were
  fownd per meanes of men the King of Firando sent out after them, and
  brought back againe to the Hollanders.</p>
<p>Gizamon Dono, Zanzabers wives brother, brought me 3 wilduckes for a present.
  He tould me that word was brought to the kyng that 80 barkes are cast
  away betwixt this and Shiminaseke now of late per torment, most being
  laden with rise. God bless our bark sent with merchandize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 11.</i>&mdash;The king being ready to goe up to the Emperour,
  we laid out a present and sent hym, I going after, accompanid with
  Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<ul>

    <li>2 damaskt fowling peeces.</li>

    <li>5 pec. white baftas of 20 Rs. <i>corg.</i></li>

    <li>5 pec. blew byrams of 15 Rs. <i>corg.</i></li>

    <li>5 pec. chader Cambaia.</li>

    <li>5 pec. buxshaws.</li>

</ul>
<p>The king tooke the present very kindly, offring us anything we would demand,
  saying that, allthough he went up to the Emperour, yet he had left
  such order with his governor that what we asked should be fulfilled.
  This present was sent this day, because yisterday Soyeman Dono came
  to aske what money the king owed upon bill, for that yt should be paid
  forthwith. Whereupon it was thought fitt to goe with this present before
  payment were made, otherwais yt might be thought it was sent in respect
  he paid the money, or else, perhaps, in payinge of it, he might have
  expected a greater present, in respect the Hollanders gave soe much
  once. Howsoever, he seemed to take it in good parte, and gave us a
  kind welcom with a colation, serveing us with his owne handes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 14.</i>&mdash;Letters came to Capt. Speck that the junk they
  sent for Syam is per contrary wind put into Shashma in a port or haven
  called Cata ura, and soe loose ther voyage.</p>
<p>And I paid 50 <i>tais</i> plate bars to the fownder, advanced upon acco.,
  for bras shivers and other matters with shot for ordinance, which he
  is to cast for to send in the <i>Hozeander</i>. The 2 fownders are
  called Jembio Dono and Scongero Dono.</p>
<p>There came certen caveleros Japons from Edo, and came to see the English
  howse, and looked on such comodeties as we had, but bought non. They
  report that the Emperour will have all the kyngs (or <i>tonos</i>)
  in Japon to goe for Edo, and there to remeane for the space of 7 yeares,
  and to carry their wives with them, and live every one in his howse
  aparte, with a servant of the Emperours to be allwaies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> in company with them&mdash;I meane with each one, to
  heare and see what passeth. This he doeth to prevent them from insurrections,
  and will not have sonns nor kynsmen, but the kinges them selves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 15.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Mr. Eaton to Edo, per Toyamon
  Dono, a merchant of that place, advising of my other sent 6 dais past,

</ul>
<p>And advised withall that Mr. Wickham should make all the hast he could,
  for that Capt. Coppendall and Mr. Nealson were very sick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 16.</i>&mdash;Rowland Thomas, the purcer of the <i>Hozeander</i>,
  being drunk, did beat Mr. Dorington, master mate, Jno. Cocera the cook,
  and the servantes in the howse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> And within night word was brought me how two of our shipps company were
  fighting with swords one a hill a littell from our English howse. Soe
  I went with Mr. Hunt the master and Mr. Osterwick and fownd them to
  be Jno. Clough the guner and Jno. Driver an ordenary marrener, both
  being drunken, and no hurt donne but that Driver had a scar on his
  forehead. Soe I put them both in the bilbows till the next mornynge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 19.</i>&mdash;Our host of Tushma came to English howse, and
  brought a present of walnuts and a Corea carpet or feltro. He tould
  me he brought merchandiz to sell to pay me the money the pepper was
  sould for, for that the money of the place he receaved for it was not
  good, as Niquan the China whome I sent to receive it could witnes,
  he turning back above 500 <i>taies</i> in receving 120 <i>tais</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Dorington, the mr. mate of <i>Hozeander</i>, mad show as though he
  were lunatick, talking idly; but I thynk he counterfeteth. A strange
  kind of people they are all of them which came in this shipp. Truly
  I canot praise any one of them which are sea men.</p>
<p>The Hollanders shott ofe 8 or ten pec. ordinance out of the small shipp
  and out of howse late within night. The occation we knew not, except
  the junk went out or that they had hard news that gave them content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 20.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Capt. Jourden to Bantam, how
  the <i>Hozeander</i> would be ready per the end of this moneth and
  how Mr. Osterwick was to stay heare, with other accurants, and sent
  it per conveance of Capt. Speck in the <i>Ankewsen</i>. I went to the
  Duch howse and delivered Capten Speck my letter. He tells me the occation
  they shot off the ordinance the last night was for that the King of
  Firando came to drink a farewell with them before he went up, and that
  the greate shipp and the junck would be ready to goe towardes Bantam
  within 7 or 8 daies at ferthest. He also tould me that he receved not
  letter of the putting of their junck into Shashma, as it was reported
  unto me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 21.</i>&mdash;I delivered two hundred and threeskore rialles
  of 8 to Andrea Dittis, the China Capt., to change into other plate
  for China busynes. More, delivered unto hym at same tyme one bag Rs.
  of 8 as it came out of England, containing one hundred pownd str.,
  is fyve hundred rialles of eight for same purpose. For both which sommes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> he is to bring refined plate to send in the <i>Hozeander</i>.
  This is donne because the nobles in China should think this plate or
  rialls com from the English, rather then to present them with refined
  plat of this place. The China Capt. sent Niquan his kinsman with these
  rialls to bring plate back forthwith.</p>
<p>Jno. Osterwick going abroad with Mr. Nealson got a littell more drinke
  than was needfull, and the other was littell better. Yet Jno. Osterwick
  fell into termes of comparison, disinabling each one but hymselfe.
  I know not what to say of hym but that he is an overweenyng prowd yowth,
  I haveing had no experience yet but only by report of Capt. Coppindale.</p>
<p>And late in the night, after we were gon to bed, the kinges <i>bongew</i> sent
  to borrow our boate, or <i>foyfone</i>,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> for
  the king service; which I lent hym.</p>
<p>The small junck was retorned to the China Capten, but much out of reprations,
  which must be amended according to promis, for without her we could
  not have carined our shipp, and soe she had lost her monson this yeare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 23.</i>&mdash;I gave 6 <i>taies</i> plate bars to Matinga to
  provide things against the new yeare. And I paid a bar of plate to
  Domingo my boy, to buy hym aparell, containing 2 <i>tay</i> 1 <i>ma</i>.
  And I reconed with Jno. Gorezano for 6 <i>tais</i>, 9 <i>mas</i>, viz.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 24.</i>&mdash;I paid fyftie <i>taies</i> plate bars to Andrea
  Dittis, China Capt., for reprations to his junk lent to carin our ship <i>Hozeander</i>,
  she haveing broken and spoild the junck that the carpenters asked 100 <i>taies</i> to
  have mended her. Newes was brought to towne that the Emperour is dead;
  but I beleeve rather it is a fable and geven out of purpose to see
  how people wold take the matter. Once the ould man is subtill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 25.</i>&mdash;Damian Marin fell out with Jno. de Lievana about
  comparisons betwixt the English and Duch, Damian takeing parte with
  the Duch and Jno. with the English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 26.</i>&mdash;The king sent Soyemon Dono, Skrayamon Dono, and
  another to look upon our comodeties, to the entent to buy for 2 or
  3000 <i>tais</i> at tyme. Soe we showed them samples of all and set
  price; but he took lyking only of pepper at 6 <i>taies pico</i>, baftas
  at 10 R. per pies, buxshaws at 9 <i>mas</i> pec., boralles at 9 <i>mas</i> pec.,
  chint at 3&frac12; <i>mas</i> pec., and cader Macoy at 4 <i>mas</i> pec.
  And tould the China Capt. he would com and vizet me before he went
  to Miaco, to morrow or the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 27.</i>&mdash;Capt. Speck came and requested that we would
  take into our shipp for Bantam as much ebony as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> could in not pestering our shipp, and he would pay
  what fraight we thought fitt. And he sent me a baril <i>morofack</i> and
  4 boxes swet meate.</p>
<p>Also the king sent me word he would com to breckfast to morrow mornyng.
  So I mad the best provition I could, and the China Capt. sent me 2
  powderd storkes, and Soyemon Dono a baskit oranges.</p>
<p>And Tome Donos sonne retorned from Miaco and sent me a present of Japan
  figges. He tells me our bark with the goods is safe arived at Sackay,
  but brought no letter from Mr. Eaton nor Mr. Wickham.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 28.</i>&mdash;The King of Firando came to dyner to the English
  howse, accompanid with 7 or 8 caveleros, and took in good parte the
  entertaynment he had, and gave me a <i>keremon</i>, and a cloake to
  our <i>jurebasso</i>. He said he was to stay 3 or 4 yeares above at
  Edo; soe I think it is true that the <i>tonos</i> (or kinges) must
  stay 7 yeares, as I noted som daies past. There was three peeces ordinance
  shott affe at his entry into the English howse, and 5 at his departure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 29.</i>&mdash;In the after nowne Soyemon Dono with 3 others
  came to the English howse, to receve the comodeties which the king
  would buy upon trust; but they tould me the Hollanders had sould the
  king pepper at 5 <i>taies</i> the <i>pico</i>, and therefor thought
  I would not aske more. I answerd that, yf the Hollanders set pepper
  at that rate, they sell other comodetis at a hier, which, it might
  be, cost them nothing but the suting of a peece of ordinance, as silke
  at 240 <i>taies</i> the <i>pico</i>, etc. And, it might be, in pollecie
  set pepper loe, to the extent to cros us and soe ether to make us to
  sell it better cheape then it cost or else to make us fall into dislyke
  of the king, and by this meanes get themselves favour and us disgrace.
  But the truth was, I set it at no hier a rate then I sould to others
  for ready money, and at such a price as I wold promis them to deliver
  no more at that rate. But for broad cloth, which they set at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[
  105]</a></span> 14 <i>taies</i> per <i>tattamy</i>, and Syam wood at
  3&frac12; <i>taies</i> the <i>pico</i>, that I would sell hym at same
  rate, when our shipps and junck arived. Yet, doe I what I could, they
  said they durst not with their honor geve more then the Duch sould
  for. Soe we concluded to send the pepper to Osekay to Mr. Eaton at
  kinges charg, and he to sell it, and then to deliver the procead in
  money to the king. And so that matter was ended. But we delivered comodety
  to them for acco. of king as followeth, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  China 7 daies past from Langasaque; from whence he sent me a peece
  of rofesate red velvet for a present, and desired me to lend his wife
  20 <i>taies</i> in his abcense to buy her provition, for which he would
  be accomptable at his retorne, and Andrea Dittis his shewrty for repament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 25.</i>&mdash;We had greate canes of the China Capt. to make
  an arbor or shed for a vyne; and 6 rayles or <i>nuquis</i> at 12 <i>condrins</i>.
  And a <i>bose</i>, frend to Capt. China, sent me 3 or 4 trees, 1 of
  peches and the rest of flowres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 26.</i>&mdash;Ushenusque Dono gave me a greate vine tree, which
  I planted in our new orchard on the west side our gadong.</p>
<p>And a cavelero of Tabilo sent the China Capt. an oring tree, a pear tree,
  and 2 peche trees, with other flowers, which he gave all to me to plant

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 28.</i>&mdash;All the kayes of our howse dores, being 6, were
  stolne, and one of them sould in truck of rise, which coming to my
  knowledg, I laid hould on hym which bought it to bring forth the partie
  which sould it, and kept hym prisoner in our English howse all night,
  but could get nothing of hym. Soe, upon the word of the China Capt.
  with 2 other neighbours, I let hym goe free upon his promis to looke
  out for the partie which sould it. And soe we sett up a bill in writing,
  that I would geve a bar of plate to hym which brought the kayes.</p>
<p>We had but 3 oryng trees from Sugien Dono, the[y] bing so great the bark
  could bring no more.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 29.</i>&mdash;About nowne the King of Shashma passed by Firando
  and came to an ancor a league from Firando; whither I went to vizet
  hym, being accompanid with Mr. Osterwick, and carid a present of 2
  barilles wyne, 2 bundells fysh, and 2 damaskt fowling peeces.</p>
<p>And at our coming to the roade where he staid at an anchor, we fownd Tonomon
  Samme, the kinges brother, with Bongo Samme his uncle, ready to present
  the King of Shashma with a present, as also Capt. Speck was ready to
  doe the lyke for the Hollanders, having 3 other merchants to accompany
  hym. But Tonomon Samme willed us both to stay till they had byn first
  with hym, and sent me word I should com next after; yet the Duch pressed
  forward by meanes of Zanzabars brother in law, and stept into the bark
  before me. But at his retorne I tould hym, that all might heare me,
  that he knew well my place and ranke was to have gon before hym, and
  caused our <i>jurebasso</i> to signefie as much to the King of Shashma,
  and that the King of England had vassales much greater then the prince
  (or county) which governed the Hollanders, and that their state or
  government was under the comand of the King of England, he haveing
  garrisons of English souldiers in their cheefest fortres or places
  of strength they had. In fine, the King of Shashma took notis of my
  speeches, and sowne after sent a great lord unto me to thank me both
  for this present as also for the other the yeare past, and withall
  sent me 10 bars of silver waying 43 <i>tais</i>, and the lyk som, as
  I understand, was sent from hym to the Duch, after they had byn with
  us.</p>

  allso divers peeces of China stuffs, but I think they were
  for his followers, for they put up a petission to the king
  (as I think) to have trade into his cuntrey, but, as I
  understand, were put offe till his retorne. As also I deliverd
  hym the Emperours letter, procured formerly, to have trad
  into all his dominions; but he gave me no answer, but sent

  from the Emperours Court, he would com and vizet our English

  English howse with the present, to thank hym for his paynes, and that
  I did not expect any present at all, yet, it being sent from so greate
  a prince as the King of Shashma was, I could not refuse the receaving
  therof. He retorned me answer that it was not for the vallu of the
  mony that the king sent it, but only as a token of good will, according
  to the Japon custom, and that I might be ashewred, yf we had a mynd
  to trade into Shashma, that we should be welcom and find that greate
  man ready to further us in what he might for the good entertaynment

<p>Mr. Nealson, Mr. Osterwick, and my selfe went to dyner to Oyen Donos this
  day, and were well entertayned, and amongst other speeches we had conferrence
  of the Hollanders presuminge to have entrance to the King of Shashma
  before us, and of my reproving Capt. Speck for it, etc. But all took
  it rather for a reproofe to the Duch then otherwais, in respeck the
  King of England keepeth garnison in the princepall fortresses they
  have, at his charge. The Hollanders can not deny yt.</p>
<p>There came 2 Spaniardes from Edo this day, and tould me it is comenly
  reported above that the Emperour is dead, and that they met the King
  of Figen going to Shrongo with greate forcese. So they esteeme there

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 13.</i>&mdash;Pasquall the Spaniard made enquiry which of the
  English in Firando was Mr. Wickhams kinsman, and in the end it proved
  to be Mr. Osterwick, unto whome he sent <i>recoudo</i><a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> that

  sould it for a greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> price, but could not. Thus now am I not deceaved in
  hym, that I imagened he had made an India voyag in the Liqueas, having
  fingered 4 or 5 <i>cattis</i> of exellent amber greece, which made
  hym to stand upon his puntos to have gon away in som Japon junck or
  Holland ship for Pattania or Bantam. Yet let both hym and the world
  judg of me yf I dealt frendly with hym (I meane Mr. Wickham), when
  I let hym put to acco. what he would, and yet, over and above, lent
  hym one hundred and fiftie rialls of eight to make benefite of, and
  gave hym as much with it of my owne to doe as a frend, yf occation

  Holland to be as much as the King of England, yf not more.</p>

  10000 <i>taies</i>, is 2500 li. sterling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 2.</i>&mdash;We reared the frame under the north side of our howse

<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;The sonne of Tuan Dono of Langasaque departed to sea
  with 13 barkes laden with souldiers to take the iland Taccasange, called
  per them soe, but by us Isla Fermosa. And it is reported he is at Goto,
  staying for more succors which are to com from Miaco, and thought they
  mean to goe for Lequea, to look for Fidaia Samme.</p>
<p>Peter, our new porter, and Miguell, Corean <i>jurebasso</i>, went about
  to have gotten a Japon servant to the Jesuistes to have served in our
  English howse, which I refused to doe; but Peter let hym lodg one night
  in the howse, which Gorezano tould me of, which both the other took
  soe in snuffe that they thretned to kill Gorezano. Soe I turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> Piter out a dores. Which Miguell, in his usuall drunken
  humor, stomocked and entered into termes with me that I had no reason
  to doe it; soe I turned hym out lykewaies to beare the other company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 8.</i>&mdash;I delivered one hundred <i>tais</i> plate bars to
  Mr. Osterwick, wherof he delivered 50 <i>tais</i> lyke to Mr. Eaton
  to goe to Ikanoura to buy tymber, because Skidayen Dono deceaveth us.</p>
<p>The perticulars of tymber is as followeth, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>May 10.</i>&mdash;We had 2 barkes lading flat stones of Tome Dono and
  Cushcron Dono, to pave yard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 14.</i>&mdash;Unagense Dono sent me a present of halfe a wild bore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 15.</i>&mdash;I wrot 3 letters to Mr. Eaton, China Capt., and Jor.
  Durois, advising Mr. Eaton to com away with what tymber he had bought
  and buy no more, but bring 3 or 400 bags lyme. And sent these letters
  per Skeyo that was our skullion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 16.</i>&mdash;I receved three hundred and fyftie <i>taies</i> plate
  of bars of Oyen Dono, in full payment for the ould debt due per King
  of Firando, besides or above the 3000 <i>taies</i> due per hym last.
  I say the King of Firando oweth 3000 <i>tais</i> over and above this
  350 <i>tais</i> now paid; which three hundred and fyftie <i>taies</i> Mr.
  Osterwick receaved.</p>
<p>Also Mr. Eaton fell out with a Japon of Figen, whoe misused and struck
  hym with a staff and knockt hym downe, thinking to have kild hym, for
  spite he bought tymber at a hier rate then he. But Mr. Eaton, in defence
  of hym selfe, hath dangerously wounded the other. But the Umbrians
  took Mr. Eatons parte, other wais they Figians had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> murthered hym. Soe he stands on his gard till I send
  to cleare hym, the Umbrians protecting hym.</p>
<p>The China Capt. retorned from Langasaque, and brought me word how Mr.
  Eaton was abused by them of Fingo, and that it was a marvell he escaped
  with life. So, per his counsell, I sent a bark with 4 ores to cary
  a letter to Mr. Eaton, and withall sent an other in Japons to the <i>dico</i> of
  Ykanaura, desyring hym to have a care that no violence were offred
  to the scrivano, <i>allius</i> Mr. Eaton, for that to morrow I ment
  to send a letter to the King of Umbra, his master, to have hym set
  at liberty and retorned to me, as our priveleges geven per the Emperour
  spesefied, as the King of Firandos man could testefie, whoe I ment
  to send Mr. Nealson along with in the mornyng about same matter. And
  so I gott Jubio Dono of Crates to write me a letter to the King of
  Umbra <i>ut supra</i>.</p>
<p>Capt. Whaw, the China Capt. brother, did send me a present of vallance
  for a bed, embradered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 17.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Nelson to Umbra with the letter written
  to the king, and he carid 50 <i>tais</i> in plate bars and 10 <i>tais</i> in
  small plate with hym.</p>
<p>The China Capt. lent us leafe gould to gild one mark and 2 head tiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 18.</i>&mdash;There came a man from Umbra about the quarrell of
  the Fingonians with Mr. Eaton, saying they swagered mightely because
  they thought the man would dye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 19.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Mr. Nealson at Fooky,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> 3
  leages hence, being staid per contrary wind, but departed from thence
  this mornyng before day. Also the small bark I sent to Mr. Eaton with
  a letter retorned, and tells me the man which he hurt is in no danger
  of death; yet, not withstanding, they of Umbra will suffer no man to
  speake to hym, not so much as hym which carid hym my letter, nor a
  Spaniard which came to hym from Langasaque with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> a present. I think it is the saturnecall humor of the
  ould kyng, because he is a Christian, he being a mortall enemy to that
  name for hatred of the Jesuistes.</p>
<p>And, after we were gon to bed, Tonomon Samme, the Kinges brother, sent
  me word that he ment to send an expres to the King of Fingo, and that
  yf I would write he should carry my letter. I retorned hym word that
  I knew not what to write to Fyngo till I knew the certenty of what
  passed in Umbra, which will be when Mr. Eaton and Mr. Nealson (which
  went for hym) retorned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 20.</i>&mdash;I went to Soyemon Dono to tell hym I marveled them
  of Umbra used the scrivano (<i>alius</i> Mr. Wm. Eaton) soe hardly
  that they would suffer no man to speake with hym nor let hym have victuelles
  for money. He answered me that the Umbrians kept such ward about hym
  for his good, because the Fingonians, being above 150 persons, had
  mad bragges they would kill hym, and, Ikanoura being a littell towne
  or village, were afeard of the worst, and so kept ward; but that they
  skanted hym of victuells he marveled, but he was assured it was not
  of mallice, but knew the place was bare of provition, and that I might
  rest assured that, when the <i>bungew</i> with Mr. Nealson were arived,
  that Mr. Eaton should presently be set at liberty; and in the meane
  tyme I must have pasience, for their trowble was much more then ours.
  He also tould me that yf I would write Mr. Eaton or Mr. Nealson, that
  he ment to send a man expres to Umbra this day. Soe I wrot them both,
  and sent them per a man sent from Firando of purpose per kinges brother.</p>
<p>We reared the building to the southward of our howse in Firando this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 21.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Jor. Durois, and ther inclozed
  the other I thought to have sent per Skeyo, kept till now per meane
  of contrary wynds, in which letter I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> advized hym of the trowbls of Mr. Eaton at Ikanaura
  in Umbra; sent per servant Bugo Same.</p>
<p>And after, we recd. in 2 barkes 1400 tils. Also we had 3 barkes lading
  ston, viz. 1 of Tome Dono, 1 of Cushcron Dono, 1 of Synemon Dono. And
  we had 35 bundells canes of the China Capt.</p>
<p>And towardes night I receved a letter from Mr. Nealson, dated in the gulfe
  of Umbra le 20th currant, and sent per the <i>bongew</i> which went
  along with hym, whoe now retorned back, with many complements from
  them of Umbra, but determen not to set Mr. Eaton at liberty till they
  had enformed the <i>Tono</i> of Fingo therof.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson went to Ikanora to vizet Mr. Eaton and furnish hym with such
  matters as he stood in need of, understanding the Umbrians kept hym
  soe short.</p>
<p>Yosky the butler, being sick, asked lycense to goe to his howse to take
  phisick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 23.</i>&mdash;Migell, our <i>jurebasso</i>, desired lycense to
  goe take phisick, being very ill at ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 24.</i>&mdash;We had fliing news how our ship the <i>Hozeander</i> with
  the Hollanders have met with the great Portingall ship of Amacan, and
  fought with her neare to the Liqueas, and som escaping out of her ashore
  retorned per way of Xaxma to Langasaque with news, but know not the
  end of the fight, whether she escaped or no. Of the which I advised
  Jor. Durois per Skeyo or his cafero in a letter; but I esteem it ordenary
  Japon news, which are lyes, dowbting (according to the English proverb)
  that it is to good to be true, yet, according to an other, I wish that
  there never com worse news to the towne.</p>
<p>Migell our <i>jurebassos</i> wife came and brought me a small jarr of <i>achar</i><a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> for
  a present, desyring me to exskews her husband in that he abcented hym
  selfe to take phisik in this tyme of busynes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>And after I was gon to bed, Soyemon Dono sent to have a <i>jurebasso</i> to
  com to hym about news they had from Ikanoura. Soe I went my selfe unto
  hym, and he tould me that the King of Fingo had sent a letter to Umbra,
  wherin he advised that, allthough the English had kild a man of his,
  he made no reconyng of it, only he was advised that som of Firando
  that was in company of the English had stolne somthing wherby this
  quarrell grew. This was the matter he sent to tell me of, and that
  to morrow they ment to send a man expres to Ikanoura about this matter.
  So I desyred hym he might carry me a letter to Mr. Nealson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May</i> 25.&mdash;Mr. Nealson retorned from Ikanaura, but Mr. Eaton
  staid behind till the <i>bongew</i> retorned from Fingo.</p>
<p>The man Mr. Eaton hurt dyed the other night, whereupon they sent for Co
  John, Mr. Eatons boy, and cut afe his head, for that he began the brute;
  and thought to have donne the lyke per Skite, because he took Mr. Eatons
  part when they misused hym, and the lyk of Tome, his <i>jurebasso</i>.
  All was about a peece of straw cord not worth a farthing.</p>
<p>And I receved 3 letters and a note from Mr. Eaton per Mr. Nealson, dated
  the 23th and 24th curant, the note manifesting the tymber, boardes,
  and lyme he had bought, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>May 29.</i>&mdash;I entred into cowncell with Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick,
  whether it were best to send Mr. Nealson back to Mr. Eaton with a bark
  to bring hym away, yf he be set at lyberty at the retorne of the <i>bongew</i> from
  Fingo, as they promised he should. So it was concluded upon, and, because
  I had ernest occation to use Gorezano in howse, I got lycense of Capt.
  Speck to have a <i>jurebasso</i> which served the Duch, which he granted
  me. But when they were ready to depart, there came a Japon and whispered
  our Duch <i>jurebasso</i> in the eare, who presently refuced to goe
  on our pretended affares. So I was forced to send Gorezano againe with
  hym and a souldier of the kinges, whom Tonomon Same, the kings brother,
  sent with them at my request. The pointes of busynes tuching Mr. Nealsons
  proceading apeareth in a memoriall of this date, the coppie wherof

  wherin were 2 horses with provition of meate for them and 4 or 5 persons
  to look unto them, but per stormy wether were broaken from the shipp
  and cast on the cost of Xaxma, having passed much danger, the bark
  being sunke, and 4 got upon a peece of tymber, living 5 days without

<p><i>June 5.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Figen a Camme, King of Firando,
  dated in Shrongo 18 dais past, with 3 salmons for a present. Also he
  writes me of the good entertaynment the Emperour gave hym, with lycense
  to retorne to Firando when he pleaseth, and that the Empr. gave hym
  18 <i>keremons</i> or gowns, with 18 storkes or salted fowles, for
  a present, a matter much esteemed in these partes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>Also I receved a complementall letter from Torayemon Dono, with another
  inclosed for the China Capt. which I delivered presently. Torayemon
  Dono advized of presentes geven the king.</p>
<p>And after dyner Mr. Nealson retorned from Ikanaura with Mr. Eaton and
  the <i>bongew</i> of Firando which went to Fingo, and Mr. Eatons host
  of Langasaque who went to vizet hym at Ikanoura so sowne as he heard
  he was in trowble, and hath kept hym company ever since, conveaying
  a musket and other armes into prison to defend hym against them of
  Fingo, yf they went about to offer violence, offring his person for
  his defence till the death, yf need required.</p>
<p>The <i>bongew</i> which went for Fingo retorned with answer to them of
  Umbra that they should set the Englishman at liberty, for that he would
  not medell with them, being under the Emperour his protection; and
  that them of Fingo, which began this brute, went upon their affares
  without knowledg to hym, and therefore he would not defend them in
  the action. Yet, notwithstanding all this, they of Umbra would not
  deliver Mr. Eaton in 2 dais after the news came, siting still in <i>dancons</i> or
  councell about it, making delayes, keeping hym baricaded till the last
  hower. And, although the other <i>bongew</i> used Mr. Eaton kindlie
  at first, and let Mr. Nealson goe and vizet hym, yet after he restrayned
  hym and would not let hym speake with hym in 2 daies. Their hatred
  against us (I meane them of Umbra) is per meanes of the padrese or
  pristes, who stered them up against us to make us odious to the Japons,
  for they are all, or the most part, papisticall Christians in Umbra,
  and attribute a great (or cheefe) occation of banishment of them out
  of Japon per meanes of the English, many papistes and Jesuistes lying
  secretly lurking in most partes of Japon till this hower. Yet I hope
  in tyme to use the lyke frenship to them as they have donne now to
  us. And it is serten them of Umbra are enemies to them of Firando,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> for that Foyne Samme recovered from them much land
  which they had taken from Doca Samme his father, and added much of
  Umbra unto it, which they of Firando pocesse till this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 6.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Mr. Wickham, dated in Miaco
  le 22th ultimo, with an other from Co. Jno. <i>jurebasso</i>, both
  per the <i>keremon</i> sellar or mercer, with 2 barrill wyne, cost
  both 13 <i>mas</i>, with 2 <i>catabras</i> for Matinga, 2 for his woman
  Femega, and 1 for Mr. Eatons woman. He writes that the King of Xaxma
  with Frushma Tay and other <i>tonos</i> were com to Miaco, and all
  other permitted to retorne for their cuntres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 7.</i>&mdash;Mr. Eatons host enformed me how he was in Cochinchina
  when Mr. Peacock was kild, and that the King of Cochinchina knew nothing
  thereof, and that he thought, yf we sought, we might have restitution
  of all. He sayeth they were 5 men which murthered both the English
  and Duch, wherof 2 were of Cochinchina, 2 Japons, and the other a China,
  their names being as followeth: Mangosa Dono, Sanzo Dono, Japons; Mangosa,
  Mr. Peacockes host; Hongo, a China; Uncam, <i>bongew</i> of junk, Amy, <i>bongew</i> of
  bark, of Cochinchina.</p>
<p>I offred hym that, yf he would put me in suffitient sureties at Langasaque
  to be answerable that he should render the Wor. Company a just accompt
  of all he recovered or receaved, that then I would geve hym power to
  follow the matter, and be bownd to geve hym satisfaction for doing
  thereof to his owne content, and procure the Emperours letter to the
  King of Cochinchina, yf need so required. So he gave me answer he was
  content to put me in sureties to content. The present was geven hym,
  as well in respect of the paines he hath taken with Mr. Eaton, as also
  for hope we have to employ hym upon Cochinchina busines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;This day was a Japon feast, being the 5th day of
  ther 5th month, called by them <i>Gunguach goriore</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p>The China Capt. sent me 2 small <i>barsos</i> of wine and 2 fishes for
  a present this Japon feast, and the fatt China telior and buton maker
  sent me 1 <i>barso</i> and 2 fyshes. And I sent the China Capt. a salmon
  and a phan.</p>
<p>I was enformed that the King of Firando spake not with the Emperour, but
  only was permitted to enter into a chamber, where they said he la sick
  in a littell cabbin coverd with paper, Codgkin Dono, the secretary,
  going into it and telling hym that the <i>Tono</i> of Firando was there
  to vizet hym, and came out againe, telling hym the Emperour thanked
  hym and gave hym lycense to retorne to his cuntrey. But they verely
  beleeve he is dead, and that they keepe it secret; yet it may be a
  pollecie to see whether any will rise against hym in armes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 9.</i>&mdash;We trid our elle speare afore oure howse, and took
  65 fresh elles.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaton gave his boy Co Johns aparell and <i>wakadash</i> to his father,
  with 5 mas in plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 11.</i>&mdash;We had 2 boattes lading paveing stoones of Cushcron
  Dono and Tome Dono; but the Duch grudged to let us have them, saying
  the king had geven them the iland and per consequence the stoanes.</p>
<p>Mr. Nealson fell out with me extremly this day, misusing me as he hath
  donne the lyke many tymes before, which I have put up and still borne
  with his contynewall drunken humors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Jo. Durois, dated the 12th
  currant, new stile, which is 10 dayes past, with a note in it, dated
  the 18th ditto, new stile, in both which he writes how it is certenly
  reported the Emperour is dead, with other news of Japon; as also to
  send back his negro or slave, yf I can procure it.</p>
<p>2 Chinas came and vizeted me, and brought me a present of a jarr China
  wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 13.</i>&mdash;Heare is reportes geven out that Fidaye Same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> is alive and in keeping of the <i>Dayre</i>,
  and that, the Emperour being dead, it is now mad knowne,
  and that he shall be Emperour and his fortresse at Osakay
  built againe. But I doe verely think this is a lye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 14.</i>&mdash;This night past came an expres from the king, how
  he was at Anushma, a port of Faccata, som 30 leagues hence, and that
  he ment to be at Firando to night or to morrow. So Soyemon Dono and
  other caveleros went out to meete hym, or rather to goe to hym to the
  place where he is, the wind being contrary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 16.</i>&mdash;The Kyng of Firando arived at Firando about midnight,
  and the Duch shott off certen chambers at his passing by their howse.</p>
<p>I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to Oyen Dono to desyre hym to tell the king
  that I was glad of his Highnes health and safe retorne, and that I
  would com and kis his handes, yf he weare at leasure, and, whiles he
  was speaking with Oyen Dono, the kyng per fortune or else of purpose
  passed by and gave our <i>jurebasso</i> very kind words and said I
  should be welcom whensoever I came.</p>
<p>Tayamon Dono envited us to dyner, I meane all the English, he being our
  master carpenter, and our work all most ended.</p>
<p>I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> also to Semi Dono and Taccaman Dono to bid
  them welcom home, and to tell them I would come and vizet them when
  they were at leasure.</p>
<p>Semi Dono sent me word, it was certen that the ould Emperour was dead
  26 daies past, and that he saw the place where he was buryed; and that
  Shongo Samme did it of purpose, that they might see he was dead. And
  the presentes which were geven to eache <i>tono</i> were the legasie
  of the dead Emperour, being greate matters both in bars of gould and
  vestmentes. And that Shongo Samme gave them leave to stay 3 yeares
  without retornyng to vizet hym, to take theire ease for the paynes
  they had taken in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[
  143]</a></span> tym past. But I do verely beleeve he will sowne rise
  againe, yf any wars be moved against his sonne within these 3 yeares.</p>
<p>Gonrock Dono passed by yister night to Langasaque, to be governor; which
  doth rather conferme me in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 17.</i>&mdash;The grownd on the W. side our new gadong did shrink
  with the extreme rayne, and 3 panes of our orchard wall fell downe
  and spoild divers frute trees, and all the rest of the wall much shaken
  and lyke to fall, the grownd geving way.</p>
<p>We went and vizetted the king, all of us together, viz.: Mr. Eaton, Mr.
  Nealson, Mr. Osterwick, and my selfe, and carid a present of 2 barrilles
  wyne, and 20 cordes of drid fysh of cuttell, and shell fysh, of eather
  10 cordes, with a small pott of conserve of oreng flowers. He was accompanied
  with Bongo Samme his uncle, and the father of Sugen Dono of Umbra,
  and 2 <i>bosses</i> or pagan pristes, with the agent of Crates. He
  took our vizetation and present in kind parte, offring us any thinge
  we stood in need of; and soe I craved pardon, telling hym I would retorne
  som few dayes hence to kis his Highnesse handes, after he had rested
  hym selfe of his journey, to make knowne som matters unto hym and to
  have his Highnesse councell therin.</p>
<p>The king had a flat galle pot in his handes and his uncle an other, which
  som body had presented unto them. So he asked me whether we had such
  in our countrey, and I answered we had. So he desyred, yff any came
  in our shiping, that they might be kept for hym. And, retornyng to
  the English howse, by chance Mr. Nealson had such a one as the others
  were, but paynted after an other fation. So I sent it to the king,
  which he took in good part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 18.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted Semydone and Taccaman Dono, and
  carid each of them 2 small <i>barsos</i> wyne with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> 10 cordes drid fysh, 5 of a sort to each one. They
  tould me the ould Emperour died 28 daies past, and that all is now
  in quiet to Xongo Samme his sonne, in respect of the death of Fidaia
  Samme.</p>
<p>After I was in bed, Yesimon Dono sent me word he understood of a ship
  or junck that was on the cost of Firando, near an iland 3 leags hence,
  and that he had advised the Hollanders the lyke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 19.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. tould me how he understood by som
  which came this night past from Langasaque, how they heard 2 peeces
  of ordinance shot affe per som shipp or junck, of the which I advised
  Capt. Speck in a letter sent per our <i>jurebasso</i> Gorezan. He retorned
  me answer that he had the lyke reportes brought unto hym, and had sent
  out men to heare yf it were true, but could heare of no such matter.
  And, sowne after, others brought news how they heard 3 peeces ordinance
  shot affe. So I sent out a boate, with 6 ores, to look yf they could
  see any shipping on the cost; but they retorned sowne after, the wether
  being dark and much rayne, and could see nothing.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck said he desired to talke with me about the state of Japon,
  for that he dowbted their might be som alteration by meanes of these
  reportes of the death of the Emperour.</p>
<p>The junck proved to be a China, and went along for Faccata, not tuching
  at Firando. Yt was a small <i>soma</i> or junck.</p>
<p>The King of Firando sent to begg my 2 golden fishes which the China Capt.
  brother sent me, which, much against my will, I gave hym, having geven
  his brother the other before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 20.</i>&mdash;The King of Firando sent his chamberlen to me with
  a present of 2 Japon <i>catabras</i>, with much wordes complementall
  for that he did not come to vizet me since his retorne from the Emperours
  cort, aledging the fowle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> wether to be cheefe occation. The chamberlen also gave
  me a <i>chaw</i><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> cup
  of tynne.</p>
<p>I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to thank the king for the present he sent
  me, and to tell hym I did not esteeme my selfe worthie of such honer
  as his Highnesse did unto me in sending me such a present. He retorned
  answer, he esteemed me worthie of much more, and was ashamed it was
  no better, yet desird me to take it in good parte, such as it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 21.</i>&mdash;Towardes night came news that a junk or ship was
  seene upon the cost of Firando, 4 or 5 leages offe. So the China Capt.
  went out in a boate, and Jno. Cocora, our cooke, with hym.</p>
<p>And about midnight came an Englishman with a letter from Mr. Jno. Baylie,
  merchant, and an other from Mr. Richard Row, master of the <i>Thomas</i>,
  who is arived within 5 leages of Firando, and com per way of Molucos,
  and came from Bantam the 20th of January last.</p>
<p>I went abord the <i>Thomas</i>, and procured boates from Firando to toe
  her in. So she entred the harbour about nowne, and shot of 3 peces
  as we passed per the Duch house, and 11 for the towne, coming to an
  ancor. Jacob Speck, the Duch Capt., came abord before she came in,
  and brought a present of 2 barilles wyne, 2 hogges, and a salmon, and
  had 3 peces ordynance at his departure. And the Duch answered with
  chambars, both as we passed as also at his departure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 23.</i>&mdash;The king sent to have a note of what comodities
  was com in our ship, to thentent to send it to the new Emperour. So
  I gave it hym. Also we procured orders from king to set up in the ship
  that no Japon should com abord without leave, to prevent stayling and
  cozening the marreners, which the Japons are adicted unto.</p>
<p>The King of Firando retorned 8 fowling peces which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> Emperour should have had; but, now he is
  dead, Safian Dono retorns them.</p>

  and came into Japon last yeare.</p>

  and jugges more sent hym this day, as also Semy Dono had 2 galle pots
  and 10 gren podingers. And Skiamon Dono had 2 or 3 broaken gally pottes

  was a faggot of steele let fall over bord per neclegence of handing
  in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 27.</i>&mdash;Albaro Munois, Alferis Tuerto, and Pasqual Benois
  came this day to Firando from Langasaque, and came to the English howse
  to vizet me. I think their coming is to learne what newes is at Molucos
  and Surat, the which I did not want to tell them the turuth. Albaro
  sent me a present of 2 bandes and cuffes, with three roles of rusk,
  and Alferis Tuerto a jar of conserves.</p>

  my opinion was to send her for Osackay. Also, not to sell lead under
  7 <i>taies</i> per <i>pico</i>. This letter I sent per conveance Mr.
  Albartus.</p>
<p>Sr. Albartus came to vizet me, accompanid with his host and others, with
  a banket, <i>nifon catange</i>, as many others did the lyke, and late
  towardes night our host of Sackay did the lyke, and brought me a silk
  coate or <i>catabra</i>, and an other of lynen to Capt. Adames, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[
  159]</a></span> comendacons from Safian Dono, whose man he was, as
  also from Chubio Dono, his brother, with offer of much frenship. Also
  our ould host of Miaco came to vizet me, and brought 2 barrilles wyne
  for a present. He fownd hym selfe agreeved the English were gon from
  his howse, and would needes know the occation, which proved to be his
  bad usage of Mr. Wickham, who lodged above 3 months in his howse, in
  all which tyme he never would so much as eate nor drink with hym, but
  gave out bad wordes against all our nation. Soe I sent hym away with
  good wordes, telling hym I knew by report he was a ruch man, and needed
  not to care for any for the English (as he reported), nether would
  the English be undon whether they lodged in his howse or in an other.</p>

<p><i>August 6.</i>&mdash;Our ould host of Sackay, with our boateman and
  Domingos mother, came to vizet me, and brought me presentes of frute,

<p>Also I wrot 2 other letters, one to the King of Firando, and the other
  to Andrea Dittis, the China Capt., and sent them per the kinges bark
  now retorning to Firando. In the kinges letter, I recomended our English
  howse and our affares to the tuition of his Highnes in my abcense,
  desiring hym to have a fatherly care therof, and to assist them which
  I left in all occations they stood in need of.</p>

  me that I went not to kisse his Lordshipps handes, by reason of the
  fowle weather and the hast I made to goe to the Emperour, but that

  and sent me word I should be welcom, and that I should fynd hym ready
  to doe ether me or our nation any good he could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  we lodged this night at Fushema, the charges of the howse amonting
  unto 8 <i>ta.</i> 8 <i>ma.</i> 0 <i>co.</i></p>
<p>I thought good to note downe that, as we passed along the river side before
  we came to Fushima, we saw a dead man cast upon the shore, whome had
  byn murthered by som villans; yet the cuntry people let hym lye, and
  not geveing hym buriall. And on the other side was a man cursefied
  upon a crosse for murthering a merchantes servaunt. And in an other
  place (as we passed) I saw som 8 or 10 malefactors heades set upon
  tymbers by the hie way side. Yf it were not for this strict justice,
  it were no liveing amongst them, they are so villanouse desperate.
  And I thought good to note downe that, coming to Fushima, which is
  but 3 leagues from Miaco, we were enformed that som villanous people
  sett upon the gard which kept the 30 bars Oban, which was ofred for
  sallary to hym that would discover the murtherer of the <i>bose</i> (and
  could be no other but the murtherers them selves), yet carid away the
  gould at nowne dayes. This is the report, but whether it be true or
  no I know not. It is said this cruel [men] have vowed to kill many
  men.</p>

  an arme of the sea of som 21 leages, to have shortened our journey
  as also to save chargis. But about midnight the sea began to rise with
  a stiffe gale wind easterly, soe that we altered our determenation

  with rayne, so that it might be accompted a tuffon. One of our barkes
  which carid our goodes lagged behind, and so got not in the mornyng
  tide, as we did, soe that she ran a greate risge to have byn cast away
  by laysynesse of the barkmen. But our <i>bongew</i>, with Goresano <i>jurebasso</i>,
  behaved them selves so that they got the bark into a creeke (not without
  much danger, runing over sholes), being assisted with the men and marreners
  of one of the Emperours barkes, which la endocked in the same creeke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>This night began the feast of the dead, and candels hanged out all night.</p>

  sowne after most parte of the day, but espetially in the after nowne;
  and towardes night proved a tuffon, very extreme wether, yet dry wether
  all night following and not much wynd. We could not know this night
  whether our goodes be much wet or no, the villanous barkmen are occation
  that we got not all ashore before the tuffon came, as we did out of
  our barke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 17.</i>&mdash;We fownd our goodes not so bad wett as we thought,
  soe, haveing opened the fardelles and new packt them, we got to bed
  this night to a place called Ocasaqui,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> it

  Oban, with 200 <i>jins</i> to the howse, and spent 400 <i>jins</i> per

  up Fidaia Samme, his enemie. It is thought it will goe hard with Masamone
  Dono, his father-in-law; and speeches are geven out that the Jesuistes

  say to be shaved a prist and to remeane theare the rest of his daies.
  All his owne men are taken from hym, and he sent with a gard of themperour
  his brothers men. His wife he hath sent to Massa Moneda Dono, her father.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 20.</i>&mdash;We dyned at Cackingaua, the towne where the castell
  is where Calsa Samme la all night. We met hym and others on the way
  in 3 or 4 troups, but could not well understand in which of them he
  went, because he kept hym selfe close in a <i>neremon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> It

  then the King of Firando hath. Also their is speeches that the Emperour
  is making ready forcese to goe against Massamone Dono.</p>

  Samme, but to confine hym into the pagod aforsaid for 10 yeares, and
  in the end, fynding hym conformable, to use his discretion.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to Mr. Wickham of our arivall heare, and how Jno. Cook

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 25.</i>&mdash;The wether proving extreme fowle, we were constraind
  to stay at this place called Odowar.</p>
<p>I thought good to note downe how, in the tyme of Ticus Samme, there was
  a strong castill in this place, kept by one Wigen a Dono (whoe marid
  the doughter of Ogosho Samme, the deceased Emperour). This stood out
  against all the forcesse of Ticus Samme, having 100,000 men with hym
  in the castell, which Ticus seeing he could not bring hym
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> under, sent Ogosho to parly with hym and bring hym
  to reason, or else to cut his owne belly. So, upon the persawsion of
  Ogosho, he rendered up his castell, upon condition that he and all
  the rest might live peaceably without punishment. Yet Ticus Samme,
  having hym in his power, made Wigen a Dono to cut his belly, contrary
  to promis.</p>

<p>At this place two of Capt. Adames tenantes of Febys met us, and brought
  a present of 10 loves white bread and a dish of boyled beefe, with
  2 bottelles wyne.</p>
<p>And soe we went to bed to Tozuka,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> 10
  leagues short of Edo; from whence Capt. Adames went before to make
  ready his howse to receave us, and to com and meete us in the mornyng
  before wee enter the city.</p>
<p>I gave our hostes doughter at Oyesa a R. of 8 which I had of Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 27.</i>&mdash;We paid the howse at Tozekay. And soe we arived
  at Edo this day about 3 a clock in the after nowne, and lodged at Capt.
  Adames howse, he meeting us at the entry of the cittie with our men
  which went afore with the goods, who arived heare also this mornyng.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames doth now understand that his brother in law Andrea playeth
  the knave with hym, which he would hardly beleeve before.</p>
<p>The King of Firandos brother sent his man unto me to bid me welcom to
  Edo. The Spanish pilot and an other Castillano came to my lodging to
  bid me wellcom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 28.</i>&mdash;The King of Firandos brother sent me a present
  of 2 barll. wyne and 2 piggs, and 1 barll. wyne and 1 pig to Mr. Eaton.
  And Codgskin Dono sent me a chist figges, 10 bundell of <i>wobi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and
  a dish musk millians; and a merchant brought me a dish grapes. I sent
  our <i>jurebasso</i> to thank them all, <i>nifon catange</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 29.</i>&mdash;Andrea, Capt. Adames brother in law, arived heare
  from Orengaua late the night past. He brought a present of fresh bread,
  with a littell sallet oyle and som poulderd beefe. He is a craftie
  knave. I noted downe this present wrong, for Capt. Adames sonne sent
  it and not Andrea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 30.</i>&mdash;Codgkin Dono sent this mornyng betymes for Capt.
  Adames, and tould hym he had spoaken with the Emperour and tould hym
  of our being heare, and that we might com with our present when we
  would. Yet they thought it best to stay till the first day of the new
  mowne, which they accompted a happie day.</p>
<p>About 3 a clock in the after nowne there hapned an exceading earthquake
  in this citty of Edo in Japon, which contynewed, from the begyning
  to the end, about the eight parte of an hower; but about the halfe
  tyme it was soe extreame that I thought the howse would have falne
  downe on our heads, and so was glad to run out of doares without hat
  or shewes, the tymbers of the howse making such a nois and cracking
  that it was fearefull to heare. It began by littell and littell, and
  so encreased till the middell, and in lyke sort went away againe.</p>
<p>About some 22 yeares past their hapned an earthquake in the province (or
  kyngdom) of Bongo, in which there was a towne (or rather a cittie)
  of 4000 howseholdes sunck into the sea, not any living creature being
  saved. And at same tyme a mowntayne neare adjoyning was clove in the
  middell. And it rayned long haire lyke unto that of mens heads.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> This hapned som two yeares before Ticus Samme died.
  And, amongst Japons, earthquaks are held for prodigious things; yet
  they say this province of Quanto is more subject to them then any other
  part of Japon.</p>
<p>We opened our merchandiz to lay out a present for the Emperour, and fownd
  wanting a treble peece of chint bramport, with above a <i>catty</i> wight
  of amber, and 9 writing table bookes; and most parte of our gally pottes
  broaken per the rude handling of our hackny men and fault of them should
  have looked to it. Also 2 bars of tyn stolne per the way, and 1 treble
  peece chint stolne heare, after they were opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 31.</i>&mdash;Migmoy brought me a present of wyne, grapes, and
  waffar cakes, and tould me that for any difference of accompt, either
  betwixt Mr. Wickham or Mr. Eaton and hym, he was content to remit it
  to my discretion. He is a craftie fello and very ruch. Amongst the
  rest, he tould me he lyked our religion so well that he ment to turne
  Christian.</p>
<p>Jno. Yossen came yisternight to vizet me and envite me to dyner, with
  Capt. Adames and the rest. I answerd hym I would vizet hym before I
  retorned.</p>
<p>There was a feeling of an earthquake 2 or 3 tymes againe this day, espetially
  about 5 a clock in the after nowne. It shaked the house mightely, but
  nothing so forsably as the other day, nor of so long contynewance.
  And about midnight following ther was an other earthquake, much lyke
  unto this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 1.</i>&mdash;This day we carid the present to the Emperour
  Shongo Samme, whoe receved it in kynde parte, Codgscon Dono and Shongo
  Dono assisting us in the matter. But it was long before we could be
  dispached, by reason all the nobles went with presents to the Empr.,
  it being the first day of the new moone. Amo[ng]st the rest was the
  King of Faccata, who as yet is not permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> to retorne into his contrey; the reason I canot learne.
  I think there were not so few as 10,000 persons at castill this day.
  It is a place very strong, duble diched and ston walled about, and
  a league over each way. The Emperours pallis is a huge thing, all the
  rums being gilded with gould, both over head and upon the walls, except
  som mixture of paynting amongst of lyons, tigers, onces, panthers,
  eagles, and other beastes and fowles, very lyvely drawne and more esteemed
  [then] the gilding. Non were admitted to see the Emperour by my selfe,
  Mr. Eaton, and Mr. Wilson. He sat alone upon a place somthing rising
  with 1 step, and had a silk <i>catabra</i> of a bright blew on his
  backe. He set upon tho mattes crossleged lyke a telier; and som 3 or
  4 <i>bozes</i> or pagon pristes on his right hand in a rum somthing
  lower. Non, no not Codgkin Dono, nor his secretary, might not enter
  into the rowme where he sat. Yet he called me once or twise to have
  com in, which I refused; which, as I understood afterward, was well
  esteemed of. I staid but littell in the place, but was willed to retorne;
  and both at my entrance and retorne he bowed his head. I forgot to
  note downe that all the rowmes in his pallis under foote are covered
  with mattes edged with damask or cloth of gould, and lye so close joyned
  on to an other that yow canot put the point of a knife betwixt them.</p>
<p>The present given was as followeth, viz.:</p>
<ul>
 <li>1&frac12; blak cloth.</li>

     <li>1&frac12; stammet.</li>
<li>1&frac12; strawcullr.</li>

    <li>2 pec. Holland cloth.</li>

    <li>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>2 pec. Sleze land.</li>

    <li>50 <i>cattis</i> tynne in bars.</li>

    <li>5 <i>picos</i> lead per tickit.</li>

</ul>
<p>I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> and <i>bongew</i> to Codgskin Dono and Shongo
  Dono to thank them for the paines they took about our busynes, and
  know of them when it pleased them I should come and vizet them to kisse
  their handes; but they were not com from the Emperours castell. So
  they left word with ther servantes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 2.</i>&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> Gorezano in the
  mornyng to Codgskyn Dono and Shongo Donos howses, to see yf they were
  at leasure, that I might com and vizet them; but he plaid the knave,
  and I think went not at all, but tould me they were gon to the castell.
  But, after Capt. Adames went, they sent me word they were at home.
  So I made what hast I could; yet, before I could com, the Emperour
  had sent for them, so I lost my labour, and retorned to my lodging
  with the presentes, refering it till to morrow.</p>
<p>And sent the accompt to Mickmoy to peruse over, for that I would make
  an end before I retorned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 3.</i>&mdash;We carid 3 presentes, all alike, to Codgskin
  Dono, Oyen Dono, and Wotto Dono, 3 cheefe men next to the Emperour,
  to each of them alyke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>Also I went and visited King Firandos brother and carid hym a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 4.</i>&mdash;We were enformed of another noble man neare
  the Emperor, called Ando Tushma Dono, unto whome it was thought fitt
  to geve a present as to the former, this Emperour being newly com to
  the crowne, and the Spaniard haveing geven out ill reportes of us that
  we rob and stayle from all we meete at sea, which was tould to us by
  greate men in the Emperours pallas, which is because Capt. Keeling
  tooke 3 of their shipps (I meane Portingals) coming from Surat. But
  Capt. Adames did enforme them the trew occation thereof, how they Portingals
  did still molest our shiping at Surat, so that now we had wars against
  them and comition to take either Spa. or Port. where we met them, in
  regard they took us. Yt seemeth there is many papistes in these partes,
  which would doe us a mischeefe yf they could; yet the best is, the
  Emperour and them about hym are no frendes of Portingals nor Spa.,
  and the rather for the extreme hate they beare to Jesuistes and pristes,
  whom they canot abide, and gave us warnyng that we should not com in
  their company, but rather to reveale them, to the entent they might
  be punished.</p>
<p>Jacob the Duch man, which came into Japon with Capt. Adames, came to vizet
  me, and offerd his servis to the English. He is a cawker, a pore fello.
  The Duch offerd hym 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per month the last yeare;
  but he refuced it, and after would have taken it, but then they would
  not geve it. And I put hym ofe with fayre wordes, telling hym we wanted
  no people, but had more then our trade did afford. I gave his wife
  and his sister each of them a single pece chint bramport.</p>
<p>Also we gave 2 pec. grogren, 3 pec. chint bramport, and 6 duble bookes
  to the secretaries of Codgkin Dono and Oyen Dono.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>This day in the after nowne, about 4 a clock, was an other earthquake,
  but of small contynewance, and gave but one great shake.</p>
<p>Mrs. Adames and her sonne sent me a letter from Oringaua, with a peec.
  pouldren beefe, exskewsing their not coming to Edo, in respeck of the
  Spaniardes which did lie at their howse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 5.</i>&mdash;We went to Ando Tushma Dono with a present as
  the other, wanting a small looking glass and som sortes gally pots,
  with 2 maps of London and 88 (<i>sic</i>). This man was not within,
  yet we left the present behind, and tould his man I would come and
  vizet hym when I knew he was at home.</p>
<p>A ruch merchant came to vizet me, and brought me a fat hoog for a present.
  Codgskin Dono sent me peares, grapes, and wallnuts for a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 6.</i>&mdash;We dyned at Jno. Yoosen the Hollanders, where
  we had good entertaynment. And, in regard of the kyndnesse he allwaies
  hath shewed to Mr. Eaton and Mr. Wickham, to goe to the Court to speak
  for them in the abcense of Mr. Adames, it was thought good to geve
  a present to his wife and doughter, as followeth, viz. 1 whole pec.
  chint bramport, containing 3 pec. of R. <i>corg.</i>; 1 peec black
  silk grogren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 7.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted Wotto Dono and Tushma Dono,
  and thanked them for the paynes taken in our affares, offering them
  to procure for them out of England anything they pleased to geve me
  notis of. They took my visitation kyndly, and said they would get our
  priveleges renewed and <i>goshons</i> or passes sealed this day, yf
  it were possibly.</p>
<p>And from thence we went rowndabout the kyngs castell or fortresse, which
  I do hould to be much more in compas then the citty of Coventry. It
  will contain in it above 200,000 souldiers in tyme of wars.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>We dyned at the Kynge of Firandos brother, where we were well entertayned.</p>
<p>And towardes night the secretary of Oyen Dono came and vizeted me at my
  lodging, and brought me a present of hense; and amongst other speeches
  he began to talke of the padres, and that it were good we had no conversation
  with them. Whereupon I tooke occation to answer hym that he needed
  not to dowbt of us, for that they were enemies to us and to the state
  of England, and would destroy us all yf they could. But that it were
  good he advized the Emperour to take heed of them, lest they did not
  goe about to serve hym as they had donne the Kinges of England, in
  going about to kill and poizon them or to blow them up with gunpowder,
  and sturing up the subjectes to rebell against their naturall prince,
  for which they were all banished out of England.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 8.</i>&mdash;We dyned, or rather supped, at a merchantes
  howse called Neyem Dono, where he provided <i>caboques</i>, or women
  plears, who danced and songe; and when we retorned home, he sent eavery
  one one of them. I had a bar of Coban gould of Mr. Eaton, containing
  6 <i>tais</i> 4 <i>mas</i>, which I gave them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 9.</i>&mdash;Jacob the Hollanders wife brought me a present
  of <i>muches</i> and other stuff, <i>nifon catange</i>, she being ready
  to depart towardes her howse.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames this day, as the lyke every day, staid at the Cort to solicet
  of dispach to get our prevelegis and passes, but still put afe; and
  amongst the rest the secretary tould hym that it was reported how there
  were semenary prists in his howse at Orengaua. So Capt. Adames sent
  away an expres with a letter to his wife to look to it that there were
  no such matter.</p>
<p>There is new edicts sent out into all partes of Japon, as namely to Langasaque,
  Arima, Umbra, and Bongo, which are most of them Christians, to see
  to it, that no padres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> be fownd amongst them, and them in whose howse they
  are fownd shall be put to death with all their generation. This must
  be followed with extremitie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;Codgskin Dono sent for Capt. Adames, which
  we hoped was to have geven us our dispach; but it proved to be nothing
  but to enquire ferther about the padres. So he retorned without doing
  any thing, they willing hym to retorne on the morrow, as they have
  donne the lyke any tyme this 9 or 10 daies, which maketh me to marvell,
  as I doe the lyke of the long stay of the Hollanders. God grant all
  be well in the south partes, and that they rise not in armes there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 11.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames was all day at Cort againe to
  attend for our dispach, but retorned without any thing; only they willed
  hym to have patience and to com againe in the mornyng.</p>
<p>Oyen Donos secretary came to vizet me, and tould me he suspected that
  our delay grew per meanes of the looking out for padres, which weare
  much sought after by the Emperour, and reportes geven out that som
  were at Capt. Adames howses at Orengaua and Phebe. So Capt. Adames
  wrot againe to his folkes, to look out that no such matter were proved
  against them, as they tendered their lives.</p>
<p>Yt is thought that the Emperour hath a meanyng to banish all Christians
  out of Japan. God grant all may fall out for the best, for our so long
  detayning maketh me much to marvill, and the Emperours hate against
  the Jesuistes and fryres very greate.</p>
<p>I receved 2 letters from Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick, dated in Firando
  the 5th and 6th ultimo, and sent by Gonosque Dono, who is com up to
  vizet Codgsquin Dono, in respect of his fathers death, and bringes
  him a present of 30 bars silver from the King of Firando. In these
  letters they adviz me of the trowble they had with the covetos mareners
  of the junck which came from Syam, and that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[
  175]</a></span> then, no news of the other 2 junks arival at Langasaque
  with Ed. Sayer. Also that the news is that the Amacan shipp will not
  com to Langasaque this yeare, she being arested per a marchant of Goa
  for money the Amacan merchantes owe hym. This news is come per a gallie
  and a galliot which are arived at Langasaque and came from the Manillias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 12.</i>&mdash;In respect we are put affe from day to day
  and canot have our dispach, I got Capt. Adames to goe to Oyen Dono,
  the Emperours secretary, accompanied with our <i>bongew</i> and Goresano
  our <i>jurebasso</i>, to geve hym to understand, yf he make any dowbt
  of the matter, that we are no frendes of the Jesuistes nor fryres,
  nether suffer any of their sect to remeane in England, but punish all
  them which are fownd with death; this coarse haveing byn kept in England
  for above the space of 60 yeares, so that the Emperour needed not feare
  our conversation with that sect, for that their hatred against us and
  our religion was more then against any others whatsoever.</p>
<p>Oyen Dono the secretary used Capt. Adames kyndly, and tould hym and the
  other 2 how the Emperour was much offended against the padres, and
  therefore advized us not to have conversation with them nor to let
  them christen any children of ours, yf we chanced to have any, for
  then they might presume we were of their sect, whome the Emperour ment
  utterly to extinguish out of Japon. He willed Capt. Adames not to think
  it long we were not dispached, the Emperours busyness being such as
  yet it could not be done, but within a day or 2 he hoped to end it
  to our content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 13.</i>&mdash;The Emperour went a hawking this mornyng with
  a troupe (as it was thought) of 10000 men. It is said he will retorne
  this night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 14.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames and our <i>jurebasso</i> went
  to the Court to get our dispach, but could not be ended to day but
  referred till to morrow. The Councell tould them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> that the Emperour would not write any letter to the
  King of Cochinchina, nor meddell in other mens matters.</p>
<p>This night past, about 2 a clock, hapned an earthquake; but of no greate
  contynewance. Som say they felt it 3 severall tymes; but I felt it
  but once.</p>
<p>We have much ado with Nico. Machievell, <i>allius</i> Migmoy, about clearing
  accompts with hym; but as yet not donne. Mr. Eaton paid Singero, the
  expres, 1&frac12; <i>tais</i> to spend per the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 15.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames went this day againe to the Court
  for to procure our dispach, but could not be ended, but refered till
  to morrow and then he to com with Codgskyn Dono, and so an end to be
  made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 16.</i>&mdash;We could not com to accompt with Nico. Machiavell, <i>allis</i> Migmoy;
  so we are forced to go to law with hym.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames went againe to the Cort to have had our dispach, but by meanes
  of the fowle wether the Councell went not to the Court, so that he
  retorned back without doing of anything. Capt. Adames envited the merchantes
  to supper to morrow that envited us the other day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 17.</i>&mdash;I receved two bars Coban gould with ten <i>ichibos</i>,
  of 4 to a <i>coban</i>,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> all
  gould, of Mr. Eaton, to be acco. for as I should have occation to use
  them in gestes or otherwais.</p>
<p>We envited them to supper which envited us the other day, and had the <i>cabickes</i> as
  they had. I gave 4 bars, called <i>ichibos</i>, to one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 18.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames went againe to the Cort to procure
  our dispatch, and fownd all the Councell busyed about matters of justice
  of lyfe and death; and, amongst the rest, one man was brought in question
  about Fidaia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[
  177]</a></span> Samme, as being in the castell with him to the last
  hower. This man was racked and tormented very much, to make hym confes
  where his master was, or whether he were alive or dead; but I canot
  heare whether he confessed any thing or no. Also the Admeralls sonne
  (our great frend), called Shonga Dono, came to towne, having byn sent
  out by the Emperour before about busynesses. He had much talk with
  Capt. Adames about sea matters, and other greate men in company with
  them. And, amongst other matters, they tould Capt. Adames that they
  understood theire were certen ilands to the northward, very ruch in
  mynes of gould and silver, which the Emperour ment to conquer, and
  asked hym whether (upon good termes) he would be pilot. He made answer,
  he was not now at his owne dispose, being servant to the English nation,
  and therefore could not serve two masters. They asked hym whether he
  had heard tell of any ilands called les Ladrones, or of the theeves.
  He answered yis, but that his opinion was that they were of no moment,
  in respect the Spaniards had not taken them, they lying in his way
  as they passed from New Spanie to the Phillippinas. They also spoake
  of an other iland, called by the Spaniards Hermosa (or Rico en oro
  y plata). He answered he had heard of such a place in conferrence with
  Spaniardes.</p>
<p>In fine, the Councell tould Capt. Adames all our dispach was ready, only
  they wanted Codgkins Donos hand, he being sick. So he was referred
  to com to morrow and bring Codgskin Donos letter.</p>
<p>Paid out to <i>cabokes</i> 3 bars Ichabo gould.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 19.</i>&mdash;We went to the Admerall yonger, Shongo Dono,
  and carid hym a present. And Capt. Adames gave hym 3 gilt Syam skins
  and a tigers skyn. He took our visitasion kyndly, and offerd us to
  do for our nation what he could. This man and his father are the trustiest
  frendes we have in these partes. And I thought good to note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> downe how this man entred into speeches about the ilandes
  Ladrones, taking them to be ruch in myne of gould and silver. My answer
  was, that I knew no such matter, but to the contrary esteemed that
  yf the[y] had byn such, that the Spaniard would have had them before
  now, they lying in the way from Agua Pulca to the Phillippinas. But
  my opinion was that yf the Emperour pretended to make a conquest of
  any, that the Phillippinas them selves were of more emportance, and
  the Spaniardes weake and ill beloved of the contrey people, and that
  herein his Ma<sup>tie</sup> needed not to dowbte the assistance both
  of the English and Duch, as occation should serve. At which speeches
  he seemed to make a pawse, and in the end said that they wanted such
  shipps as ours were. Unto which I answered, I marveled the Emperour
  did not make such, haveing both men (I meane workmen), tymber, and
  all thinges else necessary. Yt seemed to me that he tooke notis hereof.</p>
<p>Towardes night I receved a letter from Mr. Wickham, dated in Miaco the
  27th ultimo, wherin he wrot that as yet he heard no newes nether of
  our small junck nor bark that should com with wood and skins from Firando;
  which maketh me to marvell very much.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames went to the Court againe for our dispach, but was put affe
  till to morow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 20.</i>&mdash;Gonosque Dono retorned to Firando, and viseted
  me at my lodging, offring to carry my letter yf I would write; for
  the which I gave hym thanks, telling hym I hoped to follow after to
  morrow.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames went againe to the Court with our <i>jurebasso</i> to procure
  our dispach, but could not dispach till to morow.</p>
<p>Shonge Dono the Admerall made an end with Migmoy for our difference. So
  he gave twenty fyve bars Coban gould for ballance of all acco., which
  Mr. Eaton receaved.</p>
<p>Jno. Hawtery plaid the lewd fello againe, and stole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> 2 peeces chint bramport, with 2 handkerchefs
  Rumall cottony, and a peare table bookes, to geve to whores.
  Thus much we fownd and was retorned back. But we lack many
  other thinges, as of some chintes, amber beades, table
  bookes, bars of tynne, which out of dowbt he hath taken,
  but forsweareth it, as he did the other till we brought
  the partis before his face. And that which was much worse,
  he went and cut his haire after the pagon fation, thinking
  to turne pagon; which he could not do heare, allthough
  he would. Yet there wanted no good will in hym. And, besides,
  he is a comon druncard, yf he may com by drink, and when
  he is drunk is as a mad man, as ban (<i>sic</i>) a humor
  as any o the rest; for then he will fall out with all men,
  and kill and slay, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 21.</i>&mdash;Migmoy came this mornyng and brought a present, <i>nifon
  catange</i>, and with hym came a servant of Shonge Dono the Admerall,
  to make frendship. So we drunk together and parted frendes, but
  I would wish no man to trust hym any more.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames and our <i>jurebasso</i> went againe to Court to procure
  our dispach, but could not.</p>
<p>And Chubio Dono came to towne. Yocotta Kaqueamon Dono, Oyen Donos secretary,
  brought me a present of 2 <i>catabras</i>, 1 silk and the other lynnen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 23.</i>&mdash;The Emperour sent me 10 <i>kerimons</i> and
  an armor for a present, 2 <i>kerimons</i> to Mr. Eaton, and 2 to Mr.
  Wilson. And Oyen Dono sent me 5 <i>kerimons</i>, and 1 and 2 <i>catabras</i> to
  Mr. Eaton, and the lyke to Mr. Wilson and our <i>jurebasso</i>. And
  we receved of priveleges and <i>goshons</i> from the Emperour.</p>
<p>Also I sent a present to Chubio Dono; and towardes night he sent me thankes
  with letters for the King of Firando, and sent me a <i>wakadash</i> for
  a present, and 2 peces taffate to Mr. Eaton.</p>
<p>We could not by any meanes procure the Emperours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> letter to King of Cochinchina, he saying
  he would not meddell in other mens matters.</p>
<p>Goresano plaid the babbling fello against Capt. Adames, whereby Oyen Dono,
  the Emperours secretary, had lyke to have falne out with hym. Yt is
  this fellos foolish triks which hath gotten hym many enemies, and put
  me to much trowble hertofore to save his lyfe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 24.</i>&mdash;Otto Dono sent me 5 <i>catabras</i> for a present,
  with wordes complementall. And I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to geve
  hym thankes, as the lyke to Chubio Dono, and sent Jno. Yossen word
  we were ready to departe to morrow mornyng toward Firando.</p>
<p>I gave the <i>cabukis</i> 1 bar Coban and two <i>ichibos</i> of gould.
  Shezero the <i>coboke</i> sent me a Japon cap, and I gave her that
  brought it 5 <i>mas</i> 4 <i>condrin</i>.</p>
<p>We carid a present to Safian Dono. And sowne after he sent me thankes
  for it, with a box or packet of letters for the King of Firando. And
  Jno. Yoosen sent me a letter to carry to Capt. Speck. And Shonge Dono,
  the Admerall, sent me a saddell for a present. Also Otto Dono and Tushma
  Dono sent 3 <i>catabras</i> to Mr. Eaton, 2 to Mr. Wilson, and 3 to
  our <i>jurebasso</i> Goresano.</p>
<p>Migmoy got the Admerall to entreate me to com to his howse and to drink
  with hym to make frendship, as well as he had donne with me. But I
  desird his Lordshipp to pardon me, for that tyme did not now permit
  me, nether could I goe to Migmois howse in such sort without disparidgment
  unto me.</p>
<p>And so this night we packed up all matters to retorne for Firando to morrow,
  God permitting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;I sent Goresano before day to the clark of
  the Privie Seale, to fetch our <i>goshon</i> or prevelegis and to carry
  hym a present of a peece of black silk grogran. He delivered the present
  but retornd without the writing, willing hym to retorn anon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>I gave an Englishmans child, called Tho. Flood, a <i>tay</i> in Tagemon<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> plate.</p>
<p>We could not get our ould preveleges againe, and soe we [were] forced
  to departe without them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 26.</i>&mdash;I gave the <i>caboque</i> Shezero an <i>ichobe</i> and
  a silk <i>catabra</i>, and sent the master of them a bar Coban.</p>
<p>We departed towardes Orengagava this mornyng about 10 a clock, and arived
  at Febe som 2 howrs before night, where we staid all that night, for
  that Capt. Adames wife and his two children met us theare. This Phebe
  is a lordshipp geven to Capt. Adames per the ould Emperor, to hym and
  his for eaver, and confermed to his sonne called Joseph. There is above
  100 farmes or howseholds upon it, bisids others under them, all which
  are his vassals, and he hath power of life and death over them, they
  being his slaves, and he as absolute authoretie over them as any <i>tono</i> (or
  king) in Japon hath over his vassales. Divers of his tenantes brought
  me present of fruite, as oringes, figgs, peares, chistnuttes, and grapes,
  whereof there is abundance in that place.</p>
<p>The <i>cabokes</i> came out to sea after us in a boate and brought a banket.
  So I gave them a bar of Coban to make a banket at their retorne to
  Edo, and gave the boate men which rowed them an <i>ichibo</i>; both
  which soms Mr. Eaton paid out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 27.</i>&mdash;We gave the tenantes of Phebe a bar of Coban
  to make a banket after our departure from thence, with 500 <i>gins</i> to
  the servantes of howses, and 500 <i>gins</i> to the horsemen (or hankney
  men) which carid us from thence to Orengaua; the cheefe of the towne
  accompanying us out of ther presincts and sent many servantes to accompanie
  us to Orengaua, which is about 8 or 9 English miles, all runing before
  us on foote, as homegers to Capt. Adames.</p>
<p>I sent a letter to the Admerall that I ment to vizet hym
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> to morrow; but he, hearing of our coming
  hither, had sent me a letter before to envite me to com
  to hym, with many kynd offers of frendshipp.</p>
<p>After our arivall at Orengaua, most of the neighbors came to viset me
  and brought frute and fish and rejoyced (as it should seeme) of Capt.
  Adames retorne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 28.</i>&mdash;We went per water to a towne called Misackey,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> 5
  leagues from Orengaua, to vizet Fungo Dono, the ould Admerall, and
  carid hym a present. And Capt. Adames gave hym a leopardes skin and
  5 handks. chint bramport. And Mr. Eaton gave hym 2 single peces chint
  bramport. He entertayned us kyndly at dyner and sent us meate for supper,
  and gave me a <i>wacadash</i> (or short <i>cattan</i>) from his side;
  and sent his men to shew us his sonns howse newly built, being a very
  fayre place. This man is one of the best frendes we have in Japan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 29.</i>&mdash;We retorned per water to Oringaua, not without
  much diffeculty. And the Admerall Fongo Dono departed per water towardes
  Edo, to vizet the Emperour the first day of the new moone; but, the
  sea being greate and the wynd contrary, he went ashore, and so went
  overland per horse.</p>
<p>We gave our hostis at Misakay 2 <i>ichibos</i> for howsrowme and dyet,
  and 1 <i>ichebo</i> to her eldest dowghter, being wife to a Hollander,
  and 500 <i>gins</i> to her yongest doughter, and 200 <i>gins</i> to
  servantes in the howse, and 300 <i>gins</i> to the howse where Mr.
  Eaton did lye. And Capt. Adames gave presentes, viz.: 1 handkerchefe
  and an <i>ichebo</i> to Adrian the Hollanders wyfe, 1 handker. and
  500 <i>gins</i> to the mother, 1 handkerchefe and 100 <i>gins</i> to
  youngest doughter, 1 handkerchefe to Mr. Eatons hostis, and 100 <i>gins</i> to
  servantes of the howse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 30.</i>&mdash;I gave Capt. Adames 2 <i>keremons</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> Andrea, his brother in law, one of them
  the Emperour gave me. And there was geven out in presentes
  as followeth, viz.: to Capt. Adames wife, 1 pec. blak grogren,
  1 pec. sleze land, 1 cheane amber beades; and to Josephe
  her sonne, viz: 1&frac14; <i>tatt.</i> black cloth; and
  to Suzanna her doughter, viz.: 1 whole peece chint bramport;
  and to Andreas wife, 1 pec. black grogren; and to Capt.
  Adames wives mother and an other doughter, viz.: 2 single
  peces chint bramport; and 1 single pec. chint bramport
  to Adrians doughter.</p>
<p>Towardes night arived a man of Capt. Adames expres, sent from Mr. Wickham
  with letters and others from Firando, Mr. Wickham advising that by
  proclemation at Miaco, Osakay, and Sackay, it was defended that no
  Japon should buy any merchandize of strangers. Whereupon he could make
  no sales of our comodeties, and therefore did wish me, yf I met the
  expres on the way, to retorne to Edo to redrese it, yf I could.</p>
<p class="blockquot">4 letters from Mr. Nealson, of 9th, 16th, 17th, and 20th August.</p>
<p class="blockquot">2 letters from Mr. Osterwick of 8, 16 ditto.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 letter from Mr. Wickham of 19th September.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 ould letter from Mr. Wickham.</p>
<p class="blockquot">2 letters from Mr. Rowe, of 10th and 17th August.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 letter from Mr. Totton, of 20th August.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 letter from Mr. Ed. Willmot, of 11th August, from Langasaque.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;I wrot 2 letters, one to Mr. Wickham and an other
  to Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick and retorned them per same expres,
  unto whome Mr. Eaton delivered 3 <i>ichebos</i>; and he said Mr. Wickham
  delivered hym 60 <i>mas</i>, wherof he spent 43 <i>mas</i> per the
  way. And Mr. Wilson, Jno. Cook, Wm. Sweetland, Jno. Hawtry, our <i>bongew</i>,
  and others, to the halfe of our company, I sent away directly towardes
  Miaco. And Capt. Adames, Mr. Eaton, and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> selfe retorned againe towardes Edo, and lodged at Phebe.
  We gave 1000 <i>gins</i> to the servantes at Orengaua, for Capt. Adames
  nor his wife would let us pay nothing for diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 2.</i>&mdash;This mornyng fayre calme wether, or rather a littell
  wind easterly till about nowne, and then the wind vered northerly,
  a greate gust all the rest of the day, but not so much per night.</p>
<p>By meanes of this storme (we being onward on our way towardes Edo per
  water) we were forced to run over the sholes right ashore, not without
  danger; so that it was dark night before we got our thinges on land,
  and went to a towne in the way 4 leagues short of Edo, called Cowa
  Saky;<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> where
  we had bad lodging and worse fare.</p>
<p>We paid for our diet at Phebie with our hors hier from Oringaua and geven
  in the howse, viz.: 2 <i>ichebos</i> in gould and 1000 <i>gins</i>,
  paid out per Mr. Eaton. And for our boate hier to Cowa Sackey 1 <i>ichebo</i>,
  and 400 <i>gins</i> geven to a pilot to help us ashore in a place to
  land our goodes.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how Mrs. Adames sent powdered beefe, fysh, and
  bread, with rise, after us to Phebie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 3.</i>&mdash;We went to the secretary Oyen Donos howse to have
  spoaken with hym about our occation of retorne, but were perswaded
  per his men to attend his coming to the howse of justice, and there
  might speake to hym and the rest as they entred; which we did, but
  were referred of for answer till the next mornyng. So from thence we
  went to Codgskin Donos, but fownd Inga Dono, the Cheefe Justis of Japon,
  arived from Miaco and com to vizet hym. So we could not speake with
  hym.</p>
<p>Also we met there a Spaniard, com from the iland near Langasaque, where
  he was arived in a small shipp by contrary wynds going to Manilla,
  and might not be sufferd to goe out againe without lycence from the
  Emperour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p>Jno. Yoosen came to vizet me, and tould me he howrly expected the Hollanders,
  and that, tuching the cortalling of our prevelegesse, it was not to
  be suffered, it being wrought per Safian Dono and other his associates
  to have us pend up at Firando, to the entent to work upon us as they
  did on the Portingals and Spaniardes at Langasaque; but (said he) the
  Hollanders will forsake Japon before they will be bownd to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 4.</i>&mdash;A Duchmans sonne came to vizet me, and brought
  a present of powndgranetes and oringes; unto whome I gave a <i>tay</i> in
  plate fyne, paid per Gorezano.</p>
<p>I got Capt. Adames to goe to Codgskin Dono with our <i>jurebasso</i>,
  to make the occation of our retorne knowne unto hym and to aske his
  councell (as our cheefe frend) what course we shold take. He spoake
  with hym and the rest of the Councell and, as it seemeth, they will
  enlarge our previlegese.</p>
<p>A merchant, our frend, envited Capt. Adames, Mr. Eaton, and my selfe to
  supper, and sent for the <i>cabokes</i>, <i>nifon catange</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 5.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Mr. Wickham, and so to send
  it for Firando, advizing how I hoped to dispach our matters to content
  very shortly; and sent this letter per a yong man of Firando, neighbour
  to Yasimon Dono.</p>
<p>We could have no answer this day tuching our busynes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 6.</i>&mdash;We ment to have spoaken with Oyen Dono and rest
  about our busynes, but could not com to speech of them, they were so
  busye about other matters.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to the seniora at Orengaua to thank her for our kynd entertaynment.
  We carid a present to Inga Dono.</p>
<p>This man is Lord Cheefe Justice of Japon, and now newly com from Miaco.
  I made knowne unto hym the occation of my retorne, by meanes of the
  proclemation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[
  186]</a></span> Miaco that we should sell non of our goodes in those
  partes. He tould me it was true that the Emperour had sent downe such
  order, that we should have no other place of sales but Firando. I answerd
  hym that the Emperour might as well banish us right out of Japon as
  bynd us to such an order, for that we could make no sals at that place,
  as I had fownd by experience of 3 yeares space and upwardes. He answerd
  me he could not withstand the Emperours pleasure, and that at present
  all matters were in other manner in Japon then in tyme of the ould
  Emperour, and that he could do us small pleasure in the matter, it
  being in the secretaries power to do most; yet, as tyme should serve,
  he would doe his best.</p>
<p>The letter I sent to Mr. Wickham was kept till this day, and sent per
  a man of Firando, neighbour to Yasimon Dono; wherin I advized hym I
  dowbted I should not make an end so sowne as I thought, and therefore
  wished hym to send away Mr. Wilson and the rest to Firando, but, for
  the <i>bongew</i>, he might stay my comyng yf he would.</p>
<p>We went also to the howses of Codgskin Dono and the rest, but could not
  com to speech of any, they, as it seemed to me, playing least in sight,
  which caused me to write 2 letters to Cawkesayemon Dono, secretary
  to Oyen Dono, willing hym to stand our frend to solicit his master
  for our dispach; which he answered me he both had donne and would doe,
  but verely thought we could have no dispach till after the hollidaies
  or feast, which begineth the 9th currant and lasteth 3 or 4 daies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 8.</i>&mdash;We went to vizet the counsellars againe, to have
  our dispach in remembrance. And first to Oyen Dono, the secretary,
  whoe tould us that we should speake to Codgskin Dono, for that he could
  do nothing of hym selfe. Unto which I answerd that the rest did refer
  us to hym, and therefore I besought his Lordship to procure our dispach;
  for I stood in dowbt my long staying and want of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> sales of our goodes per meanes of this edict would
  be an occation I should not send away our 2 shipps and junck this yeare,
  which would be a borthen to hevie for us to beare or to answer to our
  employers. He said he would doe what he could and take councell with
  the rest what might be donne. So from thence we went to Codgskin Dono,
  whome the servantes tould us was in the house. Yet could I not come
  to speech of hym, but lost my errant with his cheefe men.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe that Safian Dono was at the secretaries howse,
  siting in a darke corner, I being cald in and apointed to syt on the
  better hand of hym, not knowing whoe he was till Capt. Adames tould
  me, which then I went on the other side and craved pardon as not knowing
  hym. In fyne, every one complayneth that matters are worse then in
  the ould mans daies, and that this man doth nothing but change offecers
  and displace <i>tonos</i>, sending and changing one into an others
  contrey; so that much grudging is at it and all in law and plitos on
  with an other, so that what will com of it God knoweth, for, as the
  comon report is, no man dare speake to the Emperour of any matter they
  think is to his discontent, he is so furious, and no meanes but death
  or distruction. So that what will come of us or our sute I know not,
  for I tell them it were as good for the Emperour to banish us all out
  of Japon as to shut us up in Firando, it being a place of no sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 9.</i>&mdash;This day was a greate feaste of Japon called Sheco,
  being the 9th day of the 9th month. So we could do nothing this day
  about our busynes at Court. But all day after nowne yisterday Capt.
  Adames and our <i>jurebasso</i> staid wayting at Court gate to speake
  with the councellers, who still geve good words.</p>
<p>Jno. Yoosen sent me word his man was com from Miaco and that the Hollanders
  would be heare within a day or two.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>And Cacozayemon Dono wrot me a letter that he had soliceted Oyen Dono
  his master about our affares, and that they were not unmindfull of
  it, but would shortly dispach us; only their busynes was much at present
  by meanes of the caveleros which came to vizet the new Emperour, as
  also for the sending away of the widdo of Fidaia Samme, doughter to
  the Emperour that now is, whoe is geven in second marriadg to a <i>tono</i> called &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>,
  whoe fought very valiently in defence of the Emperour at the overthrow
  of Fidaia Samme.</p>
<p>Mrs. Adames and her 2 children arived heare yisterday from Orengaua. And
  I gave Shezeros child an <i>ichebo</i> and Mr. Eaton delivered an other
  to the <i>tuerto</i><a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> that

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 10.</i>&mdash;Late towardes night was an uprower in the cittie
  of Edo, for that a cavelero, called Deo Dono, gave it out that he would
  take the Emperours doughter as she went to morrow towardes her new
  husband, for that the ould Emperour in his life tyme had promised her
  to hym, in respect of his service donne at Osekay against Fidaia Samme.
  But the Emperour now would not concent theirunto, but sent hym word
  to cut his bellie, which he refuced to doe, in taking of his howse
  with 1000 men his followers, whoe all shaved them selves, with 50 women
  of his, lyke wais protesting to stand out till the death; whereupon
  the Emperour caused his howse to be beset with above 10000 men armed,
  and ofred to leave his land to his eldest sonne of som 19 years ould,
  yf his servantes would deliver up the master in quiet; which coming
  to the fathers knowledg, he kild the said sonne with his owne handes;
  yet after, his servantes kild their master and deliverd his head to
  the men without, upon condition to have their lives saved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[
  189]</a></span> the lands to remeane to the other sonne; which, as
  it is said, the Emperour hath condecended unto.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 11.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted the King of Firandos brother,
  and carid hym a present of 2 barills wyne and a dish of figges, which
  he tooke in good parte and offred to send to the Emperours councell
  to desire our dispach in his brothers name, which I thanked hym for.</p>
<p>I went to Jno. Yossen to vizet hym and see what news he heard of the Hollanders.
  But, as it seems, they were not come to Osakay when Albartus wrote
  hym his letter the 23th ultimo; so God knoweth when they will hither.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 12.</i>&mdash;We went to vizet (or rather solicet) the Emperours
  councell for our dispach, but could not com to spech of any of them.
  We found our Castillano at Codgskin Donos, but could have no audience
  no more then we. And after nowne Capt. Adames and our <i>jurebasso</i> went
  agane to the Cort and sawe all the Councell together, who gave them
  fayre wordes as before, biding them com againe to morow.</p>
<p>And towardes night an expres of the Hollanders arived at this place, who
  came for a <i>goshon</i> for their junck to goe for Syam. He geveth
  it out that Mr. Baylie is dead, but I have no letters of any such matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 13.</i>&mdash;We went this mornyng betymes to Codgskin Donos,
  before son ryseinge, because we would be sure to find hym within; but
  had answer he was sick and therefore willed us to come againe at nowne,
  for that he would not goe out all this day. And so we retorned to Oyen
  Dono the secretary, and met his secretary by the way (with the Spaniard
  man), whoe tould us he was gon out, and that he want after hym to procure
  that mans dispach, which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> may be will be at later Lammas. But afterward we went
  againe to Codgskin Dono, and in the end spoake with hym and made our
  case knowne unto hym, which he seemed to pittie, and tould us he was
  not the man now that he was in the ould Emperours tyme, only he was
  of this mans Councell, and in his opinion it was not tyme now to seeke
  to alter that which the Emperour had so lately ordayned, but that in
  tyme it might be amended, our case being better considered of; and
  then we should find hym ready to assist us in what he might. Jno. Yoosen
  was theare at same tyme when we spoake unto hym, and heard what past,
  and at same tyme presented hym a letter from the Hollandes Capt. telling
  hym he was on his way to com vizet the Emperor, but held backe per
  fowle wether, yet in the meane tyme desired to have a <i>goshon</i> to
  send their junck for Syam. But Codgskin Dono answered he might stay
  for it till the Hollandes Capt. came.</p>
<p>So now I determen to put up a petition to have a lycence to sell such
  goodes as we have at Miaco and those partes, and so to retorne with
  their answer, good or bad, desiring in my petition that their honors
  will better consider of our first privelegese hereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 14.</i>&mdash;I wrot two letters, dated yisterday but kept
  till this day, the one to Mr. Wickham to Miaco, and the other to Firando
  to Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick, advising them of what is past, as
  also sending two <i>goshons</i> to Firando, one for Cochinchina and
  the other for Syam, to be a meanes to helpe to sell our junck. Also
  I wrot a letter in Japons to the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, and an
  other to Matinga; and sent all these letters expres per Jaquise.</p>
<p>Cacayemon Dono, the Emperours secretary, sent me word late yisternight
  how he had spoaken with his master, and gave me councell to send Capt.
  Adames and Gorezano our jurebasso betymes this mornyng to speake with
  his master, which they did before son rising; but he was gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> out to the Admerall of the Sea, Shongo Dono, before
  they came. So they retorned without doing any thinge. And after, the
  said secretary, Cakeamon Dono, came to me and gave me councell to make
  a petition to them all, and goe and watch them as they came from the
  Admeralls howse and deliver it unto them. He tought me to indite it,
  desyring them that yf their affares were so emportunate at present
  that they could not speake to the Emperour for enlardging our privelegese,
  that then it would please them to geve me a letter of pasification
  to the justice of Miaco and those partes, for the selling of such goods
  as we had theare, and the next spring I would retorne to renew my sute
  about our privelegese.</p>
<p>This petision I deliverd to Oyen Donos handes, which he receaved with
  a frownyng countenance, calling Capt. Adames to hym and gave it hym
  back, asking hym whie he let on com to him that could not speake, and
  bad hym bring our petision hom to his howse. Soe sowne after Capt.
  Adames went to his howse with our <i>jurebasso</i>, but could not com
  to speach of hym, and soe retorned.</p>
<p>It is said that the merchantes of Miaco are com to this place to sue to
  the Emperour that we may sell no goodes in this place of Edo nether,
  which as yet is not denid us. I am still of the opinion that the Councell,
  haveing put it into the Emperours head that it is fitt we should be
  restrayned to Firando, dare not now speake unto hym to the contrary,
  he being such a furiose man. So I dowbt we shall not now get any good
  answer, to my no small greefe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 15.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames and our <i>jurebasso</i> went againe
  betimes this mornyng to Oyen Dono with our petition, and he had them
  bring it to the castill, which they did, and in the end had for a finall
  answer that the Emperours pleasure was that we should keepe factors
  at no other place but at Firando, and for our goodes which we had in
  any other place, to put it into the custody of any Japon we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[
  192]</a></span> would for this tyme to make sales for us, but not to
  leave any factor English, nor to send any goodes hereafter from Firando,
  but to sell all theare. Whereupon Mr. Eaton and I thought good to leave
  all our goodes in the place under the custody of Capt. Adames, for
  this tyme; and he to leve order with what other he thought fyt to make
  sales in his abcense, because he goeth downe with us now to cleare
  all reconynges and to receave his sallary, due to hym per Wor. Company
  accompt to consort, he not haveing receved any thing till now.</p>
<p>Here is reportes geven out that the Emperour doth determen to put Massamone
  Dono and the Kyng of Faccata to death, with an other <i>tono</i> or
  kyng.</p>
<p>And it is said Fidaia Samme is alive; but what will com hereof I know
  not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 16.</i>&mdash;Andrea, Capt. Adams brother in law, came from
  Orengaua to Edo, and he got (I meane Capt. Adames) his writing of his
  howse at Edo out of his handes and paid hym 35 bars Coban, which is
  5 more then he was to pay; and so made an end of hym to the content
  of his senora.</p>
<p>And Caukesayemon Dono, the secretary to Oyen Dono, came to vizet me and
  to take his leave, we being to depart to morrow, and willed me to take
  patience for a while tuching our privelegese, for a matter of state
  being once concleuded could not in a day nor 2 be revoked. Yet he dowbted
  not but the next yeare it would be amended, when the Emperour and his
  Councell had well considered of the matter, as now they began to enter
  into it; for all this is donne to banish padrese out of the cuntrey,
  and that, for his master and Codgskin Dono, we might be assurd of them,
  as he had heard from his masters owne mouth; and that it were not amis,
  yf I met the King of Firando per the way coming up to the Emperour,
  to put hym in mynd to solicet the matter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>We gave this Cakeyamon Dono a cloth cloke of Mr. Eatons, in respect of
  the paines he took since our coming.</p>
<p>There was an earthquake at 5 a clock in thafter nowne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 17.</i>&mdash;We departed from Edo at 9 clock and lodged at
  Caningaua<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> all
  night, where we met the Hollanders going up, who brought me 4 letters,
  viz. 3 from Firando and 1 from Osakay, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Wickham in Osakay, le 2th October.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Baylie in Firando, 28th August.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Osterwick in Firando, le 23th August, kept till 1th September.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Nealson in Firando, 28th August, kept till 4th September.</p>
<p>Wherin they advized me of Mr. Baylies death, with many other matters.</p>
<p>I forgot we gave presentes as followeth, viz. To Mrs. Adames, 1 loking
  glasse, 1 pikture of Solloman, 2 blew tuns, 2 handkerchefs chint bramport.
  And I gave <i>cabukes</i> 6 handkerchefes and 2 bundells paper; and
  2 handkerches to Capt. Adames hostis. Also ther was 1000 <i>gins</i> geven
  to howse; 1 single peece chint bram. to Capt. Adames father in law;
  and 1 whole pec. chint bramport to Mattem Dono, a merchant, our frend.
  We gave to host at Caningaua 2160, and to servantes in howse 0200.</p>
<p>The Hollanders tould me ther junck, which came from Syam and arived in
  Shashma, was cast away coming about for Firando, goods and all, only
  men saved. Also they reported that the great Spanish shipp in Shashma
  is cast away, coming from thence to goe to Langasaque.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 18.</i>&mdash;We dyned this day at a towne called Camacra,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> which
  in tymes past (500 yeares since) was the greatest cittie in Japon,
  and (as it is said) 4 tymes bigger then Miaco or Edo is at present,
  and the <i>tono</i> or kyng of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[
  194]</a></span> that place, called &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>,
  was cheefe commander or Emperour in Japon, and the cheefe (or first)
  that took the authoretie royall from the <i>Daire</i> who was the suckcessor
  to Shacke. But now at present it is no cittie, but scattared howses
  seated heare and theare in pleasant valles betwixt divers mountaines,
  wherin are divers pagods very sumptuouse and a nunry (or rather a stews)
  of shaven women.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> I
  did never see such pleasant walkes amongst pyne and spruce trees as
  are about these pagods, espetially 5 of them are more renowned then
  the rest.</p>
<p>But that which I did more admire then all the rest was a might[y] idoll
  of bras, called by them Dibotes,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and
  standeth in a vallie betwixt 2 mountaynes, the howse being quite rotten
  away, it being set up 480 years past. This idoll is made siting cros
  legged (telor lyke) and yet in my opinion it is above 20 yardes hie
  and above 12 yardes from knee to knee. I doe think there may above
  30 men stand within the compas of the head. I was within the hollownes
  of it, and it is as large as a greate howse. I doe esteem it to be
  bigger then that at Roads, which was taken for 1 of the 7 wonders of
  the world, and, as report goeth, did lade 900 camells with the ruens
  therof. But for this, it is thought 3000 horses would nothing neare
  carry away the copper of this. In fine, it is a wonderfull thinge.</p>
<p>Som report this cittie to be destroid with fire and brimston; but I enquired
  of the enhabetantes, and they say they never heard of any such matter
  but only that it was burned and ruenated by war.</p>
<p>From Camacora we went to Fugesao<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> to

  to Sammabash, and paid for dyet, night and mornyng, 2000 <i>gins</i>,
  and to servantes of howse 300 <i>gins</i>.</p>
<p>We met an expres per way, sent per Duch for Edo, but upon what occasion
  I could not learne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 21.</i>&mdash;We went to dyner to Cambara<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>;

  Capt. Adames fell afe horse, 500 <i>gins</i>, viz. 300 <i>gins</i> to
  a bonsetter and 200 <i>gins</i> to the howse. For it is to be understood
  that a burd flying out of a hedg caused Capt. Adames horse to start,
  so that he fell backward and put his right shoulder bone out of the
  joynt, and 1000 to one that he had not broake his neck. And we went

  dyner, to our host Stibio, where we paid for dyner 2000 <i>gins</i>,
  and to the folkes of howse 200 <i>gins</i>. And we gave a present to
  Stibio and his wife, 1 pec. blak silk grogren, 1 single pec. chint
  bramport; and I gave his yongest sonne 2 <i>ta</i>.</p>
<p>And in respect Capt. Adames feared his arme would goe out of joynt againe,
  he thought it best to stay 4 or 5 daies at Shrongo, and we to goe before.
  So we went to bed to

  We met Georg Durois a league before we came to this towne, going to
  the coast to seeke justis against Safian Dono. He gave me a box of
  marmalad, and delivered me 2 peare silk stockinges, I silver caller
  and other black, with 2 peare white wollen stockinges, but set no price
  till he retorne to Firando. He tould me that it was the littell Spanish
  shipp that is cast away neare Shashma, and not the greate. Also he
  said that the great shipp which is in Shashma bringeth newes that the
  Kyng of Spaine hath mad proclemation that all the English and Duch
  pirattes that rob at sea, that he will take them under his protection,
  and geave them freely all such goods and shipps as they shall take,
  without reserving any part to hym selfe.</p>
<p>We went to bed this night to Mitsque<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>;

  goe from thence, although we arived theare at nowne, for that all were
  taken up per them which came to vizit the princes. Our host at Guanno
  tould me that it was strange to see the presentes which came daylie
  to this noble man and his wife (she being the Emperours doughter),
  for that all the noble men in Japon came to vizet hym with presentes,
  som with 100 bars Oban and as many garments (I say <i>keremons</i>),
  each one according to his degree. So that there was no day passed without
  playes, I meane comodies or tragedies. So that the rezort of people

  not vizet the princes at Guanno, as we were enformed. There went about
  20 women in the trayne we met, with the wife of the Prince of Figen,
  who went to her husband which lyeth pledg at Edo, as all the rest of

<p>We went to the <i>bozes</i> howse to dyner, called Sofa Dono, where we
  had entertaynment for a prince with all them which followed us, I meane
  Mr. Wickham, Mr. Eaton, our host, with 2 others, our <i>jurebasso</i>,
  and my selfe, and all servantes, etc. This man is a greate userer;
  and the King of Firando oweth hym much money at intrest, and, as he
  said, for his sake in whose domynions we were recedent, and per letters
  from hym was comanded to shew us what service he could, was ready to
  performe it to his power, accompting it a great honor that I would
  come under his rowfe, etc.</p>
<p>I sould this day a littell peece of currall of the 2 I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[
  199]</a></span> out in the box, containing 3 <i>mas</i> 7 <i>condrin</i> wight,
  for the som of five <i>tais</i>, yet not receved. Our host
  of Fushamy<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> came
  to vizet me with a present of orengis, being glad, as he
  said, of my safe retorne. We have much goodes at his howse,
  which they of Miaco would not suffer to enter into the
  towne, standing upon their puntos per meanes of the Emperours
  inhebitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 31.</i>&mdash;I sent Goresano, our <i>jurebasso</i>, to thank
  the <i>boz</i> for our kynd entertaynment yisterday, and to tell hym
  I thought it best to goe and vizet the Justis of Miaco with a present
  of wyne and fish, and to tell hym what order the Emperour had geven
  me to sett my busynes in order and to leave the rest with whome I thought
  good. The <i>boz</i> came unto me and councelled me not to cary anything
  to the Justice howse, for that neather he nor his deputie were not
  at home, but, yf either of them came while I remeaned heare, he would
  adviz me thereof.</p>
<p>I receved 4 letters to day per a Hollands bark, which came from Firando,
  viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Ed. Sayer, dated at Conugeshma<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> in
  Shashma, of his arivall there in our junck in greate misery, the capt.
  and many others being dead, he under God saveing her.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Jno. Ferres in Syam, le 25th of May, sent per Ed.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Edmond Willmot in Firando, le 23th September.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Nealson in Firando, le 6th of October, 1616.</p>
<p>Mr. Nealson advising me the King of Firando showed them but a sower countenance
  in their affares, and denyed them a letter of favour to the king of
  Shasma, appointing his brother after long attendance to doe it.</p>
<p>Our host of Sakay, called Tozayemon Dono, arived heare yisternight. He
  is the man which hath most holpen Mr. Wickham in our affares. I bought
  8 puppets to send to Capt. Adames children, cost 1 <i>ma.</i> 2 <i>co.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 1.</i>&mdash;Tozayemon Dono, our host at Sackay, tould me
  that Chubio Dono had advized hym to shew us all the favour he could,
  and to furnish us with 10000 <i>taies</i> in plate or merchandiz, yf
  we wanted it. Also he said, for the copper we wanted, that he would
  furnish us with it for 3 <i>mas</i> per <i>pico</i> better cheape then
  the Hollanders had bought of others. God grant all prove trew. Yet
  I have a good opinion of this man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 2.</i>&mdash;I went to se the monumentes of the towne, viz.
  the temple of Dibottes,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> with
  the hudge collosso or bras imadg (or rather idoll) in it, it being
  of a wonderful bignes, the head of it reaching to the top of the temple,
  allthough he sat croselegged, it being all gilded over with gould,
  and a great wall or plate behind the back of it the lyke, whereon was
  carved the pickture of the son. The temple of it selfe is the hugest
  peece of building that eaver I saw, it not haveing any other thing
  in it but the idoll, which standeth in a cercle or chappell just in
  the midell therof, with 4 rowes of pillars of wood, 2 on eather side,
  from the on end of the temple to the other, each one reaching to the
  top of it; the compose of each pillar being 3 fathom, and all dyed
  over with red occar, as all the temple within is the lyke. And a littell
  from the north end of the temple is a tower with a bell hanging in
  it, the bigest that ever I saw. And from the easter dore of the temple
  stand two rowes of ston pillars, of som dozen in a rowe, a pretty distance
  on from the other, going downe to a mighte huge gatehowse, on either
  side of which within stands a mightie gilded lyon, and without the
  gate on each side (as portars) a hudge giant, mad after a furious fation.
  The truth is, all of it is to be admired.</p>
<p>And not far from this temple is an other, of very neare 10 skore yardes
  in lenghe, I say ten skore; but it is narow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[
  201]</a></span> And in the midest thereof is placed a greate bras Dibotes
  (or idoll), but nothing neare the greatenes of the former. And out
  of the sids of it proceed many armes with hands, and in each hand on
  thing or other, as speares, sword, dagges, spades, arrowes, knyves,
  frutes, fyshes, fowles, beastes, come, and many other matters and formes;
  and out of the head procead many littell heades, and over the great
  head proceadeth a glory of long bras rayes made lyke to the son beames,
  as the papostes paynt over the saintes. And on both sids, to the end
  of the howse, are set 3333 other bras images, standing on foote upon
  steps, on behind an others back, all apart on from an other, with glories
  over their heads, armes out of their sids, and littell heades out of
  the great, as the Dibotes had. I enquired what those handes and heads
  did signefie; and it was answered that they signefied the good and
  charetable deeds that those saintes (or holy men) had donne while they
  were liveing. And it is to be noted that both the Dibotes and all the
  other 3333 idols were made after an excellent forme neare to the life,
  and clothed with a gowne (or loose garment) over them, and all gilded
  over with pure gould, very fresh and glorious to behould.</p>
<p>And just before the Dibotes below were set 3 or 4 roes of other idolls,
  most of them made after a furious forme, rather lyke divells then men;
  and behind them all stood two deformed ons, one carying a sack of wynd
  on his shoulders, and the other a cerkeled wreath or hoope with many
  knots in it, the one resembling the wyndes, and the other the thunder.
  In fyne, this temple is the most admerablest thing that ever I saw,
  and may well be reconed before any of the noted 7 wonders of the world.</p>
<p>And som distance westward from these 2 temples stands the sepulchre of
  Ticus Samme, <i>allis</i> Quambecon Dono,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[
  202]</a></span> thinge to be wondred at, and rather to be admired then
  to be discribed. It is a hudge big howse, of an admerable workmanshipp
  both within and without, far excelling either of the other temples,
  and within it many pillars covered with bras enameled and gilded over
  with gould; and the flowre of plankes very black, shynyng lyke ebony.
  But we could not be sufferd to enter, but only to look in a wyndor
  or grates. And to the place where the corps (or ashes) are set, yow
  must assend up 8 or 9 steps or degrees, very lardge, made parte of
  gilded bras and parte of black wood or ebony. And by the corps borneth
  a contynewall lampe, watched by a <i>boz</i> or pagon prist. And for
  the workemanshipp about that place, it exceedeth my memory to discribe
  it; only, all I can say, it may well befitt the entering of so famouse
  an Emperour.</p>
<p>And I had forgot to note downe that before the east gate of the temple
  of Dibotes stands a rownd hill of an endifferant biggnes, on the top
  whereof standeth a ston pillar, lyke the crosses in papistes churchyardes;
  which hill, as I was tould, was made of the eares and noses of the
  Coreans which were slayne when Ticus Samme did conquer that cuntrey
  som 24 or 25 years past. In fyne, we saw divers other monumentes and
  pagods, very sumptuous, with cloisters rownd about them lyke papistes
  monestaries, wherein the <i>bozes</i> or pagon pristes live in greate
  pompe, lyke our frairs and monks in Christendom, from whence it seemeth
  they had their origenall; for the pagon religion is of more antiquetie,
  and as many sectes or orders as the Christians.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames came to Miaco this day, being well amended, yet not without
  paine in his shoulder.</p>

<p>We sould our silk this day for 312 <i>tais</i> per <i>pico</i>, it being
  reported the Emperours silk was now set at sale, yt being deare. Also
  we sould the ordenary taffeties. And we sent for our broad cloth from
  Fushami to this place of Miaco, to make sale of it, our host of Sackay
  and others offering to buy it.</p>
<p>Albartus host, in his abcense, came to vizet me with a present.</p>
<p>We agreed to carry a present to morrow to Gonrock Dono, in respect he
  is the Emperours servant and may be confermed still at Langasaque,
  for ought we know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 4.</i>&mdash;I went to Gonrock Dono with a present as followeth,
  viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li> 1 <i>tatty</i> blak cloth.</li>
<li>
    1 Russia hide.
 </li>
    <li>1 pece sleze land.
  </li>
    <li>1 pece diaper napkins.
  </li>
  <li>
    1 great his gallepot.
  </li>
  <li>
    1 great flat gallepot.
  </li>

  <li>
    1 gren porenger.
  </li>
 <li>
    1 Duch jugg.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He was not at home; so I left the present and retorned.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to our host at Bingana Tome to provide iron for me as
  followeth, viz. 100 <i>picos</i> best flatt iron; 100 <i>picos</i> small
  square iron; 400 <i>picos</i> ordenary short iron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 5.</i>&mdash;I went to Gonrock Dono, accompanyd with Capt.
  Adames. He gave us frendly entertainment after the order of Japon;
  and amongst other matters asked us the price of our lead which the
  Emperour was to have, telling me it was all one to hym what price we
  set, yet withall advized me that yf we put a hier price then the Hollenders,
  that it would be ill taken. I answered that our lead was better then
  the Hollanders, and besids had cost us much money in bringing it up,
  and that our prevelegis were such that, yf the Emperour bought any
  thing, he was to pay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[
  204]</a></span> worth, and that at present it was worth 7&frac12; <i>tais
  pico</i> in this place; yet was I contented to let the Emperour have
  it for 7 <i>tais</i>, and, yf they pleased, would make the price allwais
  so hereafter, whether it were dearer or better cheape. He tould me
  he would adviz the Emperours offecers thereof. And for the steele,
  he said the Hollanders sel it to the Emperour at 2 <i>mas</i> per <i>catty</i>.
  So I condecended to sel ours at same rate the Hollanders doe theirs.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames ould host of this place, which in tymes past would have geven
  hym a <i>higo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> came

  for a present, and our <i>makary</i> man brought me a littell scritorio
  of same work. I had rather be without these presentes, for, as the
  ould saying is, the[y] bring a sprat and look for a herring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 6.</i>&mdash;Gonrock Dono sent for Gorezano our <i>jurebasso</i>,
  and tould hym that this day he would write to the Emperours court about
  our lead and steele, but could not give money for the lead above 5 <i>tais</i> per <i>pico</i>,
  because the Hollanders let the Emperour have at same rate; soe I sent
  hym back to let me have so much money as he thought fyt upon the reconyng,
  and to com to accompt hereafter, and to will hym to lend me 2 or 3000 <i>tais</i> for
  2 or 3 months. He sent me word he would looke over his accompt, and
  what money he could spare he would lend me.</p>

  Hollandes host.</p>
<p>We changed 850 <i>taies</i> ordenary plate for good plate, at 3 <i>mas</i> per
  100 <i>taies</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>boz</i> Sofo Dono brought me a present, 2 <i>barsos</i> wyne, 2
  hense, and 2 bundelles sea weed.</p>

<p>A small earthquake this night past at midnight, but of small endurance,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 8.</i>&mdash;Goresano our <i>jurebasso</i> foolishly fell
  out with our host Tozayemon Dono of Sackay, and went togeather per
  the eares with hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 9.</i>&mdash;I receved seven hundred <i>tais</i> of Gonrock
  Dono, upon accompt for 100 <i>picos</i> lead and 10 <i>picos</i> stile
  for themperour, and gave hym 2 billes of my hand, viz. 500 upon lead
  and 200 upon stile, the price referred to Oyen Dono and Codgkin Dono.
  The stile was delivered at Firando, and the lead I must deliver at
  Osakay.</p>
<p>The 10 of the ward where we lodged in Miaco, with 10 other princepall
  men, came to vizet me with a present, <i>nifon cantange</i>, only to
  see the fation of our English habit and our behavior. I used them in
  the best sort I could, they offering me any kyndnes they could about
  our busynes.</p>
<p>Also in the afforenowne there was an earthquake, but of small contynewance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 10.</i>&mdash;We sould the quicksilver for 185 <i>tais pico</i>,
  and brod cloth at divers prices. And I bought 54 Japon bookes printed,
  of their antiqueties and cronocles from their first begyning, cost
  8<i>ta.</i> 9<i>ma.</i></p>
<p>Albartus the Hollander retorned from Osakay and came to vizet me. He sayth
  how Codgskin Dono hath sent the King of Firando word to come up, sick
  or whole, although he dye per the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 11.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Firando to Mr. Nealson and
  Mr. Osterwick of my arivall heare, and will com downe with as much
  hast as I may, with other matters; and sent it per conveance of our
  host of Sackay and his man.</p>
<p>And I gave host at Miaco a pece corall of Mr. Tottons, containing 8 <i>mas</i> 1 <i>condrin</i>.</p>
<p>So we departed from Miaco and went to bed to Fushamy.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[

<p>And so went to bed to Osakay, Mr. Eaton falling extreme sick of a fever

  of Osakay came after us and brought us another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 13.</i>&mdash;We sould the rest of our lead this day to our

<p>I sent the governour word I would come and vizet hym to morrow.</p>

<p>This Shemash Dono is Ogosho Sammas doghters sonne, and the Emperour now
  is his uncle. He used us kyndly and promised to write to themperour
  for enlardging of our prevelegese. And his secretary is a greate man
  and doeth all. This prince accompanid me quite out of his castell,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 16.</i>&mdash;I got our host Tozayemon Dono to send his men
  to look out for our <i>goco</i> copper, to have it ready to lade to
  morrow, as also to get 2000 <i>tais</i> in plate ready to carry along
  with me; for that I could not stay, tyme being past, but would leave
  Mr. Wickham a day or 2 to bring the logg and to accompt with hym. So
  he promised me all should be donne to content.</p>
<p>Also I receved a bason and ure from our <i>makey</i> man at Miaco; cost
  4 <i>ta.</i> 5 <i>m.</i> 0 <i>co.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 17.</i>&mdash;Georg Durois retorned from Edo without doing
  any thing, and came from Osakay to this place to vizet me. He sayeth
  Safian Dono was com away before he arived at Edo, which was the occation
  he could do nothing. I gave hym councell that, when Safian Dono came
  to Langasaque, he should get some frendes to make way to hym, and to
  tell hym he had rather have a littell with his favour then all with
  his ill will, desyring hym to consider his povertie.</p>
<p>We bought 9 bundells paper, comen sort, to writ letters, 100 sheetes in
  a bundell, for 3 <i>mas</i> 4 <i>condrins</i> per bundell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 18.</i>&mdash;I went to Safian Dono to know whether he would
  lend me any money upon intrest, as he promised me; but he put me afe
  to Gonrok Dono his nephew, whome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> he said had charge of his busynes, and he drove me
  afe with wordes, ofring to deliver me money for all our sappon<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> which
  was com in this junk, at 22 <i>mas</i> per <i>pico</i>. So I left of
  that matter and retorned to bed to Osakay, having first receved in
  good changed plate of Tozayemon Dono our host one thousand two hundred <i>tais</i>,
  upon accompt of lead and other merchandiz, the lead at 7 <i>tais pico</i>;
  and gave hym a present. This Tozayemon Dono hath lent me 1000 <i>tais</i> gratis,
  besids all other favors donne in our busynes, he having donne more
  then all the rest.</p>
<p>Also we paid hym for our dyet in his house 16 <i>tais</i>, and to the
  servantes 2 <i>tais</i>.</p>
<p>And I gave Mr. Eatons littell doughter Helena a silk coate, and to her
  mother a single pece chint bramport.</p>
<p>Our host sent 3 men with pikes to accompany us to Osakay, with pikes because
  it was late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 19.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to our host of Sakay, Tozayemon
  Dono, to com to Osakay forthwith, to geve order for lading of copper,
  and to bring rest money along with hym, changed or unchanged. Also

<p> <i>November 20.</i>&mdash;Our host Tozayemon Dono came from Sakay and
  brought me eight hundred <i>tais</i> more to mak the other up 2000 <i>tais</i>.
  And Eche Dono retorned from Miaco with rest of the bar copper, being
  50 <i>pico</i>, which was laden abord the bark, and the rest is in
  house ready to lode to morrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Eatons boy Domingo is to make hym a new bond to serve hym 7 yeares
  in these partes, or at Syam, Cochinchina, or Patania, but not to goe
  for Bantam nor for England; and is for 10 <i>tais</i> plate delivered
  his father and mother a yeare past.</p>
<p>And per lyk agreement he is not to carry Susanna his sister out of Japon,
  which is to serve the lyk tyme for 5 <i>tais</i>; but he to fynd meate,
  drynk, and cotes to both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 21.</i>&mdash;Our host of Osakay, Cuemon Dono, gave me a silk <i>kerymon</i> and
  2 silk <i>catabras</i>, with 2 sackes rise, 5 sackes charcole, 3 sackes
  salt, and 5 salted coddes, for a present; and gave Capt. Adames, Mr.
  Wickham, Mr. Eaton, Fesque Dono our <i>bongew</i>, and Gorezano our <i>jurebasso</i>,
  each of them a <i>keremon</i> of silk, with other matters to our followers.
  And sowne after the Governor sent me an other present, viz. 5 silke <i>keremons</i>,
  2 <i>langanates</i>, and 2 barelles wyne; and sent to buy 2 pec. corall,
  which I sent to hym as a present from my selfe.</p>
<p>Gorezano our <i>jurebasso</i> having falne out with divers of my frendes
  by means of his fowle tong, espetially now of late with Tozayemon Dono,
  our host of Sackay, I willed hym to make peace with hym, or else I
  would not entertayne hym any longer; at which my admonisions he set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> light, as well as at Capt. Adames, Mr. Wickhams, Mr.
  Eatons, and others. Whereupon I put hym away. This fellos fowle tong
  hath much injured me and others, namely Capt. Adames, against whome
  he gave out speeches at Emperours court, that he was an occation we
  gave not a greater present to the Emperour and to others, which hath
  procured Capt. Adames much ill will, and the lyke to all of us. This
  Gorezano had byn a dead man long ago, yf I had not saved hym, and have
  this reward for my labour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 22.</i>&mdash;I receaved fowre hundred <i>tais</i> of Mr.
  Wickham upon acco. of Tozayemon Dono, and gave Mr. Wickham up a note
  of all the monies I receaved to carry downe, since I arived at Miaco;
  which amounted to eight thousand eight hundred forty and six <i>taies</i>,
  eight <i>mas</i>, and seven <i>condrins</i>, wherof 7650 <i>taies</i> were
  packed up in 6 chistes to goe for Firando, and the rest in an other
  chist to lay out for iron and other matters at Bingana Tomo.</p>
<p>Sadaye Dono, the governors secretary, sent me 2 Japon pistolles for a
  present. And sowne after came a servant of Calsa Sammes to vizet me
  with a present of frute, telling me (as from his master) that he was
  sory he could not doe me any pleasure in respect he was in disfavour
  with the Emperour his brother; but, yf it were otherwais with hym hereafter,
  that then he would do that which now he canot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 23.</i>&mdash;Our host brought us <i>cabuques</i>, 3, one
  the cheefe, with their musick, and staid all night. I gave the cheefe
  a bar Coban. And Echero Dono, Mr. Eatons ould host, brought me a present
  of a <i>bento</i>, or box for 5 persons to eate in, and a fyre harth
  from his wife; and Shroyemon Dono, a pike and 10 papers fyne rise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 24.</i>&mdash;Gorezano made frenship with Tozayemon Dono,
  and would have gladly gotten to be <i>jurebasso</i> againe; but I would
  not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 25.</i>&mdash;I gave the cheefe <i>caboque</i> I single pec.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> chint bramport, and her maid 5 <i>mas</i> in
  plate, and so sent them away.</p>
<p>And we departed from Osakay towardes Firando in the after nowne. We put
  over bar of Osakay at night, and divers frendes came after us with
  banketes for a farewell.</p>
<p>We got this night to a place called Taccasanga, 20 leagues from Osakay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 26.</i>&mdash;So we [made] 25 leagues this day, and came to
  an ancor about midnight, it being calme, and so stopped the tide.</p>
<p>This day passed a <i>foyfone</i><a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> by
  us with 20 ores on a side, wherin went a <i>bongew</i> of the King
  of Biengos,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and
  came and spoke with us, seeing we were strangers, and sent me a dozen
  of larks for a present. So in requitall I sent hym a small <i>barso</i> of
  wyne and a salt cod, which he took in good parte, sending me word,
  yf we put into any port of his masters province, we should be welcom
  and have any favour shewed us we stood in need of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 27.</i>&mdash;We waid ancor an hower before day and rowed
  it up, haveing somtyme wynd and somtyme calme. And so towardes night
  arived at Bingana Tomo,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> haveing
  met a bark of Firando per the way, whoe tould us our 2 shipps and junk
  were all ready and attended our coming, wishing us to make hast. We
  made this day 15 leagues.</p>
<p>At my coming to Bingana Tomo, I thought to have fownd 600 <i>picos</i> iron
  ready bought and waid out, as I writ our hostis; but fownd nothing
  donne per meanes iron was so deare, as the worst sort at 17&frac12; <i>tais</i> per <i>pico</i>,
  and second at 21 <i>mas pico</i>, and non of best sort to be had. So
  I had thought to have sent back an expres to Osakay to Mr. Wickham
  to have bought som theare, but upon better consideration left it ofe,
  and thought it better to carry money then iron at so deare a rate.
  But in consideration our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> hostis said she had bought 100 <i>picos</i>, worst
  sort, at 17 <i>mas</i> 2 <i>condrins</i>, I took that and meane to
  send it to Syam, the king of that place haveing writ for iron; also
  a smith of this place haveing greate store of flat iron a span broad,
  made of purpose for the Emperour, but durst not sell without consent
  of themperours <i>dico</i> or <i>bongew</i>, which he would send unto
  to know the lowest price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 28.</i>&mdash;I delivered two hundred and fyftie <i>tais</i> plate
  bars unto Mr. Eaton, to pay for iron at Bingana Tomo, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 1.</i>&mdash;We waid ancor at break of day and road it up

<p>The King of Cokera was at this place with 50 seale barkes, ready to goe

<p>And sowne after Ed. Sayer arived at Firando from Shashma, where the king
  used hym kyndly, in respect of my vizeting hym as he passed by this
  place.</p>
<p>I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to adviz the King of my arivall and that I
  ment to vizet hym to morrow. And he sent a man after to bid me welcom,
  as all the princepall of the towne did the lyke; and the neighbours
  came them selves and met me, after they heard the shipps shute of their
  ordinance.</p>
<p>And the Hollandes Capt. sent his <i>jurebasso</i> to bid me welcom and
  that he would have com hym selfe, but that he was busy writing to send
  away their ship and junck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 4.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. tould me how he had 2000 <i>tais</i> in
  fyne plate ready to send in our ship, and that he would write to his
  brother to provide more, but the worst was that Langasaque was belegered
  and all the passages stopt that no man might retorne from thence. The
  occation he knew not; only som said it was to look out for on of Fidaia
  Sammes consortes, and others that it was to look out for padres.</p>
<p>Also there was reportes that 25 saile Hollander shipps had taken the Molucas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 5.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted the King of Firando, in company
  with Capt. Adames and Ed. Sayer, with letters from the king of Shashma
  and Safian Dono; and I carid the king a present of 2 barrelles <i>morofack</i>,
  2 salmons, and 5 perfumed fans. He took it in good parte; and I gave
  hym thankes for the paynes that Fesque Dono his <i>bongew</i> had taken
  in going up with me.</p>
<p>And from thence I went to the Hollandes howse to vizet Capt. Speck, to
  know yf he would send me 2 letters in the ship that went for Bantam
  and the junck that went for Syam, which he promised me to do, as also
  to geve me a letter to Bantam to send in our shipp, to signefie that
  it was falce the reportes geven out about carrying the ebony in the <i>Hozeander</i>,
  and that he was ready to do the lyke for us upon all occations offered,
  it being the States pleasure he should do soe.</p>
<p>I wrot 2 letters, 1 for Bantam to Capt. Jourden, per Duch ship, and the
  other to Syam to Mr. Benjamyn Farry, per Duch junck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 6.</i>&mdash;I sent the China Capt. brother a <i>kerymon</i> and

  gerdelles and showes to Mr. Eatons, Mr. Sayers, Mr. Nelsons, Mr. Osterwikes
  and Mat[ingas] women; and a silver <i>chaw</i> pot and a fan to Capt.
  China wife; and a pear <i>tabis</i> with string and a fan to his doughter.</p>
<p>The king sent for me and Capt. Speck, and shewd us a letter he had from
  the Councell to tell us we should not trade into no other parte of
  Japon but to this towne of Firando and Langasaque, and to adviz hym
  eich yeare at ships coming what merchandiz we brought, to the entent
  to signefie the Emperour thereof.</p>
<p>We find per experience that the King of Shashma hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> shewd us extraordenary favor, and the Duch
  to the contrary non at all. The occation I think is the
  present I gave hym as he passed by this place to goe to
  the Emperor, the Duch not doing the lyke. So that now he
  let Matias stay allmost a month suing to speak with hym
  and might not have admittance.</p>

  junck with Mr. Peacock and Walter Carworden for Cochinchina, and related
  to me the death of Mr. Peacock cleane contrary to the report I had
  before, saying that it was by mischance, an other boate runing against
  them in a corant overthrowing theirs; and that Mr. Peacock was drownd
  by meanes of money he carid in his pocket, and that his host was in
  the boate with hym and hardly escaped with swyming, being halfe dead
  when he came ashore; and that Walter Carwarden, their host, and he
  went afterward and fownd the dead body of Mr. Peacock, and brought
  it ashore and buried it; and that Water remeaned in the contrey above
  a month after, not any one offring hym injury, yet in the end embarked
  hym selfe in the same junck he went in to retorne for Japon, carrying
  all matters left unsould along with hym; which coming to the knowledg
  of the Kyng of Cochinchina, he wrot a letter to Safian Dono, to signefie
  unto hym that he was inocent of the death of the English or any other,
  and that, yf they sent any of their nation to receave the money he
  owed them, he was ready to pay it.</p>

  Japon manour, I retornyng from above, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  to chang for better, it not being good. Also he was accused per the

<p>The king sent Soyemon Dono and an other to know whether I ment to send
  goodes to Miaco and those partes; as he was enformed I did, contrary

  for which I had receaved money of hym before hand; and that I might
  sell my goods to any man at Firando without geveng offence; and that
  he had sent his man with his chap or marke to set upon the goodes,
  and ment to com after hym selfe. So they took the answer in good parte.

<p>We laded 6 chists plate abord the <i>Thomas</i>, being in all 8000 <i>tais</i>,
  all fyne melted China plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 7.</i>&mdash;To day Taccamon Dono sent to me to end the matter
  betwixt the Japon Miguell and his consort about wood of Syam they cleamed
  in our junck, and desird me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> his sake to geve them 2 <i>picos</i>, otherwais, yf
  law proceaded, it would cost them their lives. So I condecended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 8.</i>&mdash;The King of Firando sent a writing unto me to
  have me set my hand unto it, that I sent goods up to Miaco to pay 1000 <i>tais</i> lent
  me by Tozayemon Dono. Unto which I answered I sent no goods up, but
  delivered and sould them heare to his man he sent downe to doe it of
  purpose, and shewd them my letter receved from Tozayemon Dono to same
  effect. Yet this would not serve, but he sent his man severall tymes
  to have me ferme<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> unto
  it, which still I refused, referring hym to take a recept from Tozayemon
  Donos man that bought the goods (or rather receved them) for his master.
  In fyne, this <i>Tono</i> of Firando either doth it to bring me into
  danger of sending up goods (a thing contrary to the Emperours edict),
  or else he would begyn a new custom, to have me geve hym notis of what
  goods I sell or to whome, which by my prevelegese I am not bound unto,
  but only to bring our shiping to his port of Firando, but to sell to
  whome I will without geveing notis to hym. In fine, I had much ado
  about it, with Bending of many messingers, as also employing the Capt.
  China to perswade me unto it. Yet I denid to doe it, with reason.</p>
<p>Also the <i>Tono</i> sent his <i>bongew</i> to recon with us about tymber
  they brought for reparyng our 2 shipps, as knees and beames, but all
  was ended before those tymbers came; yet would they have us take them,
  and set the knees at 20 <i>tais</i> the peece, and the beames at 100 <i>tais</i> peece,
  they in consience not being worth above the 10th parte they prize them
  at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 9.</i>&mdash;The king sent still to have me set my hand to
  a writing concernyng sending up goods to Miaco, but I denid it, and
  went to Oyen Dono to tell hym my reasons, and to enforme the kyng thereof,
  which he promised me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> doe, saving I had greate reason in doing that which
  I did; yet after I had much ado about the said matter, per other messengers
  sent, but still denid fermyng, allthough they thretned to bring the
  matter in question before the Emperour.</p>
<p>The China Capt. envited the king and the nobles to dyner, and feasted
  them both day and night with a China play; and after, they bid them
  selves his gestes againe to morrow, to have the <i>caboques</i>, or
  women plaiers of Japon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 10.</i>&mdash;I got Capt. Adames and Mr. Rowe to goe to Mr.
  Totton, to perswade hym to stay here till next monson, in respect of
  his sicknes, to the entent we might send away both shipps together;
  unto which he answerd that we might make them ready, and, yf he fownd
  he were not abell to goe, then he was content to goe (<i>sic</i>),
  or, if we pleased to let hym have the shipp to stay but 8 or 10 daies
  more, he made no dowbt but he should be well able to goe in her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 12.</i>&mdash;I went with Mr. Rowe to the king to take his
  leave and offer hym our servis, eather at Bantam or in England. He
  seemed to take it in good part, and made us colation, and soe let us
  departe. And at night he sent 2 armors of Japon for a present to Mr.
  Rowe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>January 13.</i>&mdash;We went out with the <i>Thomas</i> for Chochie.
  But the king sent word to desire us to shoot afe no ordinance till
  we came out as far as Cochi. The reason was, his brothers wife was
  brought to bead, and therefore wold not have her disturbed.</p>
<p>We had 11 boates with 2 <i>bongews</i> to toe out our shipp, and at ther
  and our retorne ashore they shot afe 7 peeces ordinance.</p>

<p><i>Febrary 5.</i>&mdash;I gave one of my best <i>keremons</i>, which themperour
  gave me, to the China Capt., he asking it to send into China about
  busynes.</p>
<p>And the Chinas came to the English howse with a hobby horse, or rather
  a tiger play, with actes of activety, many of them coming together.
  So it was thought fyt to send them somthing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 6.</i>&mdash;There was a bar plate, containing 4 <i>tais</i> 2 <i>condrins</i>,
  geven to the Chinas tiger players, in respect they were Chinas and
  sent to the English howse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 7.</i>&mdash;The King of Firando went for the bath at Ishew,
  and as he past per Holland howse they shot afe 5 chambers.</p>
<p>The China Capt. invited all the English to supper this night, where we
  were well feasted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 8.</i>&mdash;Yewkyn Dono of Shashma sent me a present of 20
  birdes, viz. wood pigions, larkes, thrushes, and gren plovers, with
  2 <i>barsos</i> wyne.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames had news his junck was arived at Sotto,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> 15
  leagues hence.</p>
<p>Mr. Totton fell into an extreme payne of puntos (or stiches), soe that
  we thought he would presently have dyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 10.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames junck came in this day about nowne,
  and the Hollanders shot affe 3 chambers as she passed by. I went abord
  with a present in a banketing box of a henne, a duck rosted, with sweetmeates, <i>nifon
  cantange</i>, and 2 bottelles <i>moroeffack</i>, a <i>barso</i> of <i>singe</i>,
  and 3 loves bread, to welcom Yasimon Dono, which Capt. Adames and he
  took in kynd part. Our <i>foyfoney</i> went to Shashma with the rest
  to toe her hither; but all the rest of the boates are com, only no
  news of her, which som take she is cast away, but I rather think it
  lasines.</p>
<p>Gorezano, our <i>jurebasso</i> that was, seeing I ment to put hym away,
  sent many to entreate for hym, which, seeing he could not preveale,
  went to Semi Dono to complaine, saying I gave it out that the king
  ment to banish hym out of Firando. Whereupon Semi Done sent 2 men to
  know yf I had geven out any such speeches; which I retorned hym answer
  I did not, only I tould Gorezano that, yf he receaved any favor from
  the kyng, it was for my sake (as being my <i>jurebasso</i>), and not
  for his owne. Also I sent hym word I offred to take all the tymbers
  and knees which were brought in my abcense (allthough they came out
  of tyme when the shipps were provided) at a reasonable rate as they
  were worth, which the <i>bongews</i> denyed. And I went my selfe to
  Oyen Dono and tould hym the lyke, as also what passed tuching Goresano.
  Unto which he made answer that the kyng knew nothing of these matters,
  which, yf he did, the <i>bongews</i> would have no thank for their
  labors, and for Goresano, all men knew his bad tong and that I had
  saved his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 11.</i>&mdash;Our <i>foyfone</i> retorned to Firando this day
  in the after nowne, it haveing byn 19 daies since she departed from
  the junck, which (as they say) was by meanes of a leake she fell in
  per meanes of the extreme fowle wether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 12.</i>&mdash;I sent Gorezano word to avoid out of our howse,
  for that I would have Mr. Totton to lodg theare, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> the entent to make cleane the <i>fro</i> against the
  Kyng of Xaxma com, it being geven out he will com ashore at Firando
  and vizet our English howse, etc. And sowne after Goresano came to
  me, telling me he was ready to departe out of our howse, yet seemed,
  to be angrey; and amongst other wordes (in presence of Mr. Osterwick)
  tould me that he could speake somthing of Mr. Eaton, but that he was
  loath to geve discontent. But I willed hym to say on. And was, that
  at Miaco one night Mr. Eaton, haveing drunk hard, tould hym that he
  would stay no longer in Japon, because the Emperour had taken our previleges
  from us; and that yf thenglish went out of Japon they would take all
  the junckes and shipping, that non should com into this place. I asked
  him whie he did not speake of this matter before Mr. Eaton went to
  Syam. He answerd he was then loath to meddell in such matters. But
  I replied that I esteemd he lyed in this matter, as well as in others,
  telling hym that Mr. Eaton could not determen of any going out of the
  cuntrey, I being his comander and over all the rest of the English
  nation. He replied it was true. In fine, he is an envious knave; so
  I bad hym doe his worst, assuring hym the least Englishmans word in
  Japon would be belived before his. He tould me he feared not the King
  of Firando, for that he could not use justice against hym, he being
  servant to Chubio Dono.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 13.</i>&mdash;I borrowed one thousand five hundred <i>tais</i> of
  Unquan the China and others, to pay the China Capt. This to be paid
  with 20 per cento intrest per my bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 14.</i>&mdash;Sinze, our barkman, brought me a present of a <i>barso</i> wyne
  and 2 fyshes, desyring me to chang his name, according to order of
  Japon, which is held a greate honer amongst them. So the China Capt.
  sayid it was good to call hym Sinemon Dono.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 17.</i>&mdash;I delivered tow bills unto the China Capt., viz.
  one of 2000 <i>tais</i> plate fyne, payable to Capt. Whaw at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> a yeare from 6th January last, with 20 per cento intrest;
  the other of 1000 <i>tais</i> same plate, payable to Gauquan, a China
  [at] Langasaque, same intrest and same tyme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 18.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames tould me that the King of Firando
  had sent hym a sharp letter, because he did repare his junck and took
  no tymber of hym, saying he would not let hym have carpenters henceforward.
  Unto which he retorned answer that he had the Emperours passe to doe
  what he did, so that yt were good he took heed how he proceaded herein.
  Yt is thought Semidone settes on the symple <i>tono</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 25.</i>&mdash;Ther was a bark set on fyre in Firando per neclegence
  of them which trymbd her, and had lyke to have set the east parte of
  the towne on fyre, had I not sent 12 men with bucketes at first, which
  staid the fury of the fyre and quenched the fyre being entred into
  a thatched howse of office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Febrary 26</i> (<i>1 Ninguach</i>).&mdash;Mr. Nealson going a walking,
  per chance fownd an alter of the ancient god Priapus (or the lecheros
  god) ... whereunto women goe on pilgremadge ... as well women that
  are with child, to have speedy deliverance, as also them which are
  barren, to be frutefull.... I remember, when I was in France, and passing
  thorow the landes betwixt the citties of Bourdeaulx and Bayon, I had
  knowledg of an imag and altar, whereon stood a pickture ... which,
  as I remembor, they called St. Puchin, to which all baron women went
  on pilgremage, to the entent to prove frutefull, and to that entent
  scraped affe a littell ... and put it into wyne and drunck it, per
  which meanes they verely beleeved they should be frutefull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 1</i> (4th of <i>Ninguach</i>).&mdash;A Byskan called Antony
  desird to have a man of his to goe in our <i>foyfone</i> for Langasaque,
  which I promysed hym; but, as I was enformed after, it was Appollenaria,
  the fryre, which thought to have gon in her, but would not com in sight
  because I should not see hym.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 2.</i>&mdash;I receved 3 letters this day, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>1 from Safian Dono, in answer of myne I wrot hym, with a letter to King
  of Cochinchina in our behalfe, to send with Capt. Adames.</p>
<p>1 other from his secretary, in answer of an other I wrot hym, and how
  his master had performed all I requested, he soliceting hym thereunto.</p>
<p>In fine both very frendly letters.</p>
<p>1 from our host Tozayemon Dono, that the boates our goodes went up in
  came so late that he could make no seales, and therefore, yf he brought
  money along with hym, it must be borowed, and that he was ready to
  com for Firando.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 3.</i>&mdash;Gorezano, our quandum <i>jurebasso</i>, came with
  our hostes man and shewed me a letter, wherin a frend of his wrote
  hym that the Duch host at Miaco was put into prison for letting Albartus
  lye so long in his howse, contrary to the Emperours edict. This knave
  did seeme to rejoyce thereat.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck arived from Xaxma this day towardes night, and had many guns,
  or chambers, shot afe at his landing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 5.</i>&mdash;We reared our pigion howse this day.</p>
<p>And towards night our host Tozayemon Dono of Sackay arived heare, but
  (as he tells me) hath not brought a peny of money, as not haveing sould
  any of our goodes. But I think he maketh use of it to send for Cochinchina,
  and I dowbt not without councell of Capt. Adames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 6.</i>&mdash;I sent Ed. Sayer with a <i>jurebasso</i> to Oyen
  Dono, to desyre hym to speake to the king to helpe us with som money,
  in respect we have such neede. He sent me answer he made accompt the
  king would be heare to night, and that at his coming he would enform
  hym thereof, saying I had greate reason in my demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 7.</i>&mdash;The King of Firando arived from Ishew in the after
  nowne. So I went out in a boate and met hym,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> as many of Firando did the lyke; and the Hollanders
  shot affe 9 chambers or bases as he passed by, but went not out to
  meete hym, for that Capt. Speck and Albartus were gon to Langasaque
  the day before. I carid a banketing box with preserved nutmeg, conserve
  of roses, a box of marmelad, and a marchpaine,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> with
  2 bottelles Spa. wyne, and a barill <i>morofack</i>, but went not abord
  the kinges bark, he not calling, but sent it home after hym, the <i>jurebasso</i> remeanyng
  theare an hower or 2, as others did the lyke, and were put affe for
  recept till the morrow after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 8.</i>&mdash;Bongo Samas man came to me and tould me, as it
  were in secret, that he heard his master say that the king his nephew
  was offended against me, but he knew not well the occation, except
  it were for that I went not to vizet hym at Ishew, or else for bringing
  Capt. Adames junck ashore without asking leave. To the first I answerd
  that I could not think the king looked for homadg from me as from his
  vassals, and that my busynes was such as I could not goe, and therfore
  had wrot hym a letter to same effect, signefying of my gladnes to heare
  that he fownd the bathes to his content. And for the junck it was none
  of myne, but belonged to Capt. Adames, whome asked leave before he
  dockt her. In fyne, this kyng is a symple man and led per bad councell,
  and so I think it will prove in the end. I am of opinion that Goresano,
  our late <i>jurebasso</i>, is a whitston to egg hym on against us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 9.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted the kyng, and carid hym 2 barilles
  wyne, 12 wood pigions, and 5 roles bread; and Capt. Adames carid hym
  2 barilles and certen stickes dryd fysh. And, amongst other matters,
  I desird leave to have laid handes one the scrivano of the junck which
  Mr. Saris came in from Syam, he being now com to towne as I understand.
  The kyng willed me to know the howse where he lodged, and that he would
  cause order geven to stay hym;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[
  241]</a></span> which I did lear[n]e out and sent hym word thereof.
  And Capt. Adames desired the kynges letter of favor to the King of
  Cochinchina; which he promised hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 11.</i>&mdash;The scrivano of the junck Ed. Sayer came in from
  Syam sent me word he was contented to deliver all matters into my handes,
  with the billes and writinges of Giquan the dead capt.; but, as it
  is said, he hath opened the dead mans chistes (6 in number), and taken
  out what his [he?] list, and now would deliver the emptie chistes to
  me. So I sent hym word he should deliver an accompt of all to Capt.
  Andrea Dittis in this place, or to Capt. Whaw, his brother, at Langasaque,
  and I would take an acco. at their handes. This scrivano made sute
  to Yasimon Dono to take up this matter, and he would geve hym the half
  of the 140 <i>picols</i> wood in sute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 12.</i>&mdash;I wrot 2 letters to Taccamon Dono and Semi Dono,
  and sent each of them a paper containing the truth of my plito with
  the scrivano. Taccamon Dono was within, but would not speake with Mr.
  Nealson, whome I sent, nor receve my letter nor petition, but sent
  them back per our <i>jurebasso</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 13.</i>&mdash;I went to Taccamon Dono in company of Capten Adames,
  and carid hym a barill wyne and 2 fyshes, <i>nifon catange</i>, and
  delivered hym my letter and paper consernyng my procese against the
  purcer, which he took in good parte, promising me justice when he had
  heard what the other cold aledg against me, but sent home the barill
  wyne and fyshes after me, for that no present was to be accepted when
  men came to crave justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 14.</i>&mdash;A comon <i>caboque</i> or Japon play was sent
  out and alowed for 7 daies space, at 2 <i>condrins</i> each one that
  entered, etc.</p>
<p>The King of Firando set a tax upon all his vassales, to make hym amongst
  them 3000 <i>taies</i> in money, and to take ryse of hym at a deare
  rate in paymt., to make money to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[
  242]</a></span> carry his charges up for Edo. And, amongst the rest,
  certen were taxed at a hier rate then the rest, because they provided
  us tymber, bisquite, and other matters at a lower rate then the king
  liked of, not asking hym leave. This is thought to be donne per the
  councell of Semi Done, whome is very much hated therefore of the comune
  people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 15.</i>&mdash;I had answer from Syen Dono, the governour, that
  the king could helpe us now with no money, for that he was put to his
  shiftes to provid money to goe to Edo. The Hollanders were answered
  as we were.</p>
<p>The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, tould me in secret that the King of Firando
  had sent a ruch <i>cattan</i> for a present to his brother Whow, to
  make accoyntance, to the entent to borow money, and that his brother
  had promised to lend hym 2000 <i>taies</i>; so that at instant the
  king sent for 300 <i>taies</i>, he wanting 150 of that som willed me
  to borow so much of Tozayemon Dono for 10 or 15 daies, to pay intrest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 17.</i>&mdash;Mr. Nealson being ill at ease went to the bath
  at Ichew, and Jno. Cook with hym. God send them their healths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 18.</i>&mdash;Taccamon Dono sent word to Yasimon Dono, that
  the scrivano of the junck Ed. Sayer came in had put up a petition against
  hym for delivering the 140 <i>picos</i> sappon into my handes, before
  the matter was ended by justice. So I gave a writing under my hand
  to save hym harmles, both against the justis and scrivano, whatsoever
  they would demand of hym tuching that matter. And after came an other
  hu and cry (as the proverb is) that the justice would not let Yasimon
  Dono goe on the voyag, except I delivered the 140 <i>piculls</i> wood
  into his handes till the matter was ended per justice.</p>
<p>Whereupon I went to the king, in company of Capt. Adames, and with much
  ado carid the said Yasimon Dono along with us to make complaint to
  the king. But, when we came theare, he would not per any meanes the
  king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> should
  know of the matter, whereby we perceved he was consorted with the said
  scrivano to parte stakes with hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 19.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames went out with his junck to Cochi,
  and soe to put to sea, and shot affe 3 chambers as he passed per the
  Duch howse, and they answered with the lyke and, when he was past,
  shot affe a pece ordinance with shott.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames host Yasimon Dono plaid the gemeny with hym to day, sending
  one to hym to tell hym he must com to the king, but after proved to
  be to the 10 of the streete, about wood staid from the <i>tico</i> of
  our junck he came in from Syam; but he answered them he had nothing
  to doe in the matter, refering them to me.</p>
<p>The Capt. China sent a bar plate to Capt. Adames and an other to Yasimon
  Dono his host, for a present at their farewell. Soe after nowne the
  junck put to sea towardes Cochinchina. God send them a prosperous voyage.</p>
<p>I delivered a memoriall to Ed. Sayer with a cargezon goodes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Also I delivered a memoriall to Capt. Adames, as apereth per coppie in
  book cargesons, with that to Ed. Sayer.</p>
<p>Unagense Dono sent me a quarter of wild boare for a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 22.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames, fynding contrary wyndes at sea,
  retorned this night past to Cochi in Firando, from whence he wrot me
  a letter per Mr. Sayer of what past, namely, that after I departed
  from hym the 19th currant, being under seale, Yasimon Dono espied a
  bark coming after them with a cloth seale, desiring him to stay for
  her, which he did, coming to an ancor. In which boate came 2 of Yasimon
  Donos brother in lawes, with littel Anthony, <i>alius</i> Sifian Dono,
  who at the first entry abord laid hold on Capt. Adames armes and, before
  he was aware, wrong hym in such extreme sort that he put hym to much
  payne; and another of his followers laid hold on the busom of Jno.
  Pheby his boteswaine, one secondyng hym with his arme out of his <i>keremon</i> as
  though he would have cut hym; and on of Yasimon Donos brother in lawes
  laid hand on the hinder part of the haire of Mr. Sayer&mdash;all passing
  in as violent sort as might be; which moved Capt. Adames to fetch out
  the Emperours passe, kissing it and houlding it up over his head, meanyng
  to protest and take witnesse of the violence they offered hym. But
  his merchantes perswaded hym to the contrary; and soe the asselants
  gott them on a sudden downe in to Yasimon Donos cabben, and sowne after
  packed ashore, not speaking to Capt. Adames.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>So I sent Mr. Osterwick abord with a letter to Capt. Adames, with a barrill
  wyne and 6 hense, advizing hym that, yf he pleased, I would bring the
  matter in question before the king, yf he please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 23.</i>&mdash;Mr. Osterwick retorned from Capt. Adames, who
  set seale this mornyng betymes. God speed them well. He tells me that
  Capt. Adames desired me not to bring the matter of his abuse offerd
  per Antony and his crew in question till his retorne; only I might
  geve out som speeches, that it might come to the kinges eares, yf I
  could conveniently do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 24.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Osterwick to the rendadors (or mint
  men) with two barill of <i>morofack</i> and 2 fyshes, <i>nifon catange</i>,
  to tell them that the purcer of Capt. Adames junck tould me that they
  sent to me to know what plate or money we sent in the same junck, which
  I gave them notis of, assuring them that we sent out no <i>fibuck</i>,
  but observed the Emperours edict; but, when we had occation to melt
  money, I would send for them, etc. So, presently after, they came to
  the English howse, haveing first sent back the present, aleadging their
  master had warned them not to receve any present. Soe I made them colation,
  and so they departed.</p>
<p>Also I went to Taccamon Dono, and carid hym the coppies of the 2 billes
  for 27 <i>cattis</i> plate, delivered Giquan the China capt. to buy
  sappon, for which the scrivano was bound to deliver me 922 <i>picos</i> in
  Japon, whereof I wanted 212 <i>picos</i>.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that Taccamon Dono took the parte of the scrivano over
  much, wishing me to geve hym the halfe of the 140 <i>picos</i> sapon
  I had in my power, and that he should deliver me all the writinges
  and goodes which belonged to the dead Capt. Giquan. Unto which I answered
  I was to demand 115 <i>picos</i> more, which he had delivered to marenars
  in Xaxma without any order to show for it and per force contrary to
  Mr. Sayers will. In fine, he willed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> me to talke with the China Capt. about the matter that
  all might be delivered into my handes, and I to geve hym a quitance
  for all, that the Chinas should not molest hym hereafter. So it seemeth
  to me this mans fist is greased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 26.</i>&mdash;Capt. Speck retorned from Langasaque, and I sent
  Mr. Osterwick to vizet hym and bid hym welcom hom. He tould Mr. Osterwick
  he had spent both tyme and money as well at Langasaque as at Shashma,
  and yet could get no justice, which, as it should seeme, mooves his
  patience, as also the slow payment of this <i>tono</i> of Firando,
  which he fyndeth as well as we, etc.</p>
<p>Here is flying reportes geven out that wars are like to ensue in Japon;
  but what will com of it God he knoweth; only I dowbt the projectes
  or secret insynewations of the fryres, jesuistes, and pristes, whoe
  have over free entrance to this <i>tono</i> of Firando, and not unlyke
  they may have the lyke to others more greater then he. God grant all
  may fall out for the best. Amen.</p>
<p>They tell of a yong man that is much sought after for being on Fidaia
  Sammas part, but still escapeth per papistes secret conveances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 27.</i>&mdash;Soyamon Dono sent for our <i>jurebasso</i> to
  speak with hym, who fownd Semi Dono with hym, and they sent me word
  that, yf any timbers were lost, I should pay for them, and that the
  king merit to desire of themperour, at his going up, to have the Hollanders
  and us to goe to som other place, for that he was awery of us and of
  our proceadinges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 28.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted Capt. Speck and tould hym what
  Semidone sent me word of, that the King of Firando would demand of
  the Emperour to have us sent out of Firando to dwell elsewhere. To
  the which Capt. Speck answerd that it might be we might be the first
  demanders for that matter, telling me he thought it was best he and
  I went together to Semidone, to know whereupon he sent such word.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<p>I wrot 2 letters to Neyemon Dono and his partner, with one for Mrs. Adames,
  all for Edo; and another both in Spanish and Japons to Tome Dono, <i>jurebasso</i> to
  Massamone Samme, to adviz hym we shall have occation to use hym at
  our going next to Edo in August next, to be <i>jurebasso</i> to the
  Emperour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Marche 31.</i>&mdash;Harry Shank retorned from Langasaque, and brought
  3 vyne trees with 14 other frute trees, dyvers sortes, with some garden
  seeds, and a little franincense to perfume the piginhowse.</p>
<p>I sent Mr. Osterwick to Semidone to tell hym the price I ment to geve
  for the tymber; but he entred into a passionate humor. He is a proud,
  beggerly, presumptious fello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 2.</i>&mdash;We bought 2 frute trees, 1 oreng and the other
  peares, for 4 <i>mas</i>.</p>
<p>Ther was a junck of China, which went out of Langasaque and bound for
  Cagallon in the Phillippinas, put back to Firando in the roade of Cochi
  per meanes of bad weather at sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 3.</i>&mdash;I paid the gouldsmith 1&frac12; <i>mas</i> for
  making me a silver instrument for my salvatory.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck sent Jacob Suager to vizet me. But I take it to be underhand,
  to know whether I would have acepted of his offer to have byn umper
  in the price of my tymber; but I said nothing to hym, nether did he
  speake of it to me.</p>
<p>A China shewmaker died on a sudden, being well not halfe an hower before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 4.</i>&mdash;Thomas the cook, lefte to attend on Mr. Totton,
  being a harebreand felloe, threw a kitchen knyfe at Balle, the kynges
  dogg, which we kept in the English howse, and stuck hym to the hart
  that he fell downe dead presently. He hath beaten many of our Japon
  servantes, and had lyke to have kild one of our neighbors servantes
  the other day. He ys not the man I took hym for, and wrot the Worll.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> Company in his behalfe more then he deserveth. Yf this
  had hapned in the tyme of Foyne Samme, who esteemed this dogg much,
  yt might have cost us all our lives. I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to
  exskewse the matter to the kyng, who sent me word he esteemed that
  the English man did it not of purpose, and therefore willed me not
  to punish hym, for the deede being donne could not be undon, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 6.</i>&mdash;There is news geven out that an embassador from
  Corea is to goe to the Emperour and is expected shortly to passe by
  Ishew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 7.</i>&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to Semidone to tell
  hym that, in respect he took the matter in hand, I was content to geve
  50 <i>tais</i> more in the whole for the tymber, that is, whereas I
  offred but 270 <i>taies</i> before, I will make it up 320 <i>taies</i> to
  geve the king content, etc. And he retorned me answer that I did offer
  well, and cowncelled me to goe to the king. I think the Hollanders
  play the jemenis, and goe underhand to buy the tymber when it is at
  the lowest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 8.</i>&mdash;I went to the king to tell hym bow his <i>bungews</i> would
  force me to take tymber at the price they pleased, I not haveing bought
  any of them, nether they bringing it in tyme to serve our shiping,
  as also that I could have no end of the procese with the theevish scrivano,
  although I had papers to show for what I asked. But the king sufferd
  me to stand, without attending, an howre, and in the end would not
  tarry to here me speake, but bad me confer with his <i>bongews</i>.
  Soe I went from thence to Oyen Dono and tould hym what past. He gave
  me councell to make an end of that matter of the tymber at what price
  I could bring them to, for have it I must; but for that of the scrivano,
  he thought the king would see me have my right.</p>
<p>The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, envited the king to dyner, with most of
  the nobles; yf a king and nobles a man may call them, I fynding no
  noblenes amongst them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 10.</i>&mdash;Mr. Nealsons boy Larrance ran away, because he
  did beate hym, which to say the truth be doth over much; yet the boy
  is the best boy in the howse. But after, he was brought back by his
  parentes and left with his master.</p>
<p>There came 2 or 3 Chinas to see our English howse, men of esteeme, and
  one of them a doctor of phisick, unto whome I geve kynd entertaynment.
  And one of them sent me a box of comfets afterwards for a present,
  thanking me for their good entertaynment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 11.</i>&mdash;Tonomon Samme, the kinges eldest brother, arived
  this day after dyner at Firando from the Emperours court. The Hollanders
  discharged 3 chambers at his passing by. And sowne after I went and
  viseted hym, and carid a present of 2 barilles wyne and 3 cases <i>mach</i>,
  containing 10 in each case; which he took in good parte. I fownd hym
  accompanid with Semidone, Sangero Samme, and all the rest of the caveleros
  in towne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 13.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. came and tould me he had receved
  a letter from his brother Whaw, from Langasaque, how themperour of
  Japon had sent out a bark, well manned with above 100 men, for the
  cost of China, wherin went 30 gentellmen with a letter and present
  of worth for the Emperour of China, as 10 rich <i>cattans</i> garnished
  with hiltes and other necessares of gould, with many pikes after same
  sort, and 2000 <i>taies</i> in bars of silver, so that they canot tell
  what to judg of the matter; only they think the Emperour of China will
  accept of nothing which cometh from them, the hatred betwixt them is
  soe greate.</p>
<p>We dyned at Holland howse, Mr. Nealson, Mr. Osterwick and my selfe, where
  we had greate cheare, both first, second, and therd course, and had
  no want of Spanish wyne, with drinking of healths to the Kinges Matie.
  and Queene of England, with the Grave Mouris and States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 15.</i>&mdash;Towardes night the Kyng of Goto sent two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> of his cheefe men to me with a present,
  he being newly retorned from the Emperours court, viz.
  2 barrilles wyne, 14 legges of pouldren venison, 10 great
  salt fyshes, 3 hand guns or calivers of Japon; offring
  me much frendship, yf our shiping chanced to put into any
  of his portes, as also to furnish them with tymber or any
  other matter they stood in need of, at as loe a rate as
  we could have it in any other parte of Japon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 16.</i>&mdash;Towardes night word came on a sudden that the
  King of Xaxma passed by and ment not to com to an ancor. Soe I provided
  a present and went out to meete hym. The King of Firando went out to
  meet hym and sent out his brother before, whoe met with us in the way
  and willed me to stay till the king his brother had been abord, and
  then deliver our present; which I ment to have donne, whether he had
  spoaken or no, and soe I tould hym. Yt seemeth he hath noe greate good
  will to the King of Firando, for he had but a word or 2 with hym, and
  so let hym departe, but kept me in talke allmost an hower, asking me
  many questions and offring me any frendship his cuntry did afford or
  that we stood in need of.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck went not to vizet hym, whatsoever the occation was; whereat
  som exceptions were taken, and, as we retorned, on of the barkes of
  Xaxma made signes to me to come abord, thinking we had byn Hollanders,
  and, seeing we were not, sent a letter by me to deliver to Capt. Speck,
  which at my coming ashore I sent unto hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 17.</i>&mdash;Ike Dono came to me this mornyng, as he went to
  the kyng, and tould me the King of Xaxma axcepted my present in good
  sort and spake much good of our nation. He also tould me that the other
  2 did expect to have had something, so, per his councell, we cut out
  2 vestes, black cloth, and 2 whole peeces chint bramport and sent to
  them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 18.</i>&mdash;I paid the gouldsmith for seting me a burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> glas in a silver frame 1&frac12; <i>mas</i>,
  and the frame waid 3 <i>mas</i> 8 <i>condrins</i>.</p>
<p>Semidone sent me a bill to set my hand unto, to pay the king 450 <i>taies</i> for
  the tymber we bought of hym. I receved a letter from Cacamon Dono,
  secretary to Oyen Dono, the Emperours secretary at Edo: a frendly letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 19.</i>&mdash;The king banished Sangero Samme, his uncle by
  a Corean woman, out of Firando, to live in a village in this island,
  5 leagues from Firando. This Sangero was Sonne to Foyne Samme in his
  ould adge by a Corean woman, and at his death he left hym 800 <i>gocos</i> of
  rise per anno. But he was no sowner dead, but the kyng, his nephew,
  shortned hym to 250 <i>gocos</i> per anno, and now hath taken occation
  to confine hym in this sort, because he dispiseth his wife, a noble
  woman of Crates, and goeth after other women ... geveing them greate
  presentes, bringing hym selfe into debt. This is the common report.</p>
<p>A <i>boz</i> of Crates came to see the English howse, and envited hymselfe
  to our <i>fro</i> with other <i>bozes</i> of Firando.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 20.</i> Easterday.&mdash;One of Towans sonns, of Langasaque,
  came secretly to see the English howse, but I was enformed per one
  of our servantes whoe he was, and soe gave hym the best entertaynment
  I could. This Towan is held to be the richest man in Japon, and com
  up of base parentage by his subtill and craftie wyt.</p>
<p>We had the Hollanders to dynner and our nighbours to supper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 21.</i>&mdash;I went to Semidone and carid hym a <i>barso</i> of
  wyne and 4 string of drid cuttell, and thanked hym for the paynes taken
  about the tymber. I also towld hym I marveled at the presumptious speeches
  of that Miguell the <i>tico</i>, who gave it out he would kill some
  Englishman, I haveinge before payd hym all he could demand, to a <i>condrin</i> of
  sappon, before the kinges <i>bongews</i>; so that I wished hym to look
  to that theefe and his companion, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> they went not abroad to doe mischeefe, but that they
  might be carid to Miaco to answer it with their lives before Ingo Dono.
  At the which he seemed at first to be mooved, yet after he said the
  king ment to goe up within 8 or 10 daies, and that, yf I would send
  a man with them, he would cary them up in bonds and deliver them to
  the justice, which I was contented withall. So after, I sent to Takamon
  Dono, cheefe justice, to signefie as much to hym; and he sent me word
  he thought it would be long before the king went up, and that it was
  better I sent them up sowner. But I answerd I had no such hast, nether
  was I willing to seek justice in an other place, yf I could have it
  heare; and to same effect sent word to Oyen Dono, the kinges governor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 22.</i>&mdash;I thought good to note downe how the Kinge of
  Firando, above a yeare past, sent me word he would geve me a howse
  rent free, which Matinga dwelled in, it being a matter of some 10 shilling
  or 2 <i>taies</i> per anno, but now goeth from his word and denieth
  it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 24.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Osterwick to our <i>bongews</i>, which
  the Kyng of Firando hath put abord our junck to see each marener have
  all belonged to them, to have them put their handes to a writing of
  the delivery thereof to their content; but they denid to doe it, yet
  by word of mouth confessed it to be true. Thus are we used in Firando
  and can have no justice, allthough we have all the right in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 25</i> (first day <i>Singuach</i>).&mdash;Yt is thought fit
  Mr. Nealson goe to Langasaque to complaine to the Emperours <i>bongew</i> how
  we can have no justice in Firando, and he carieth all our papers of
  processe against the scrivano of the junck of the dead Capt. Giquan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 27.</i>&mdash;Jno. Japon paid a <i>mas</i> of plate to the gouldsmith
  for me, for making me a Jemall gould ring.</p>
<p>We delivered 10 <i>picos</i> copper to the fownders to cast bases or small
  ordinance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Aprill 28.</i>&mdash;Jor. Durois writes me that the Kyng of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> Umbra hath taken 2 padres presoners, both
  Japons, the one a Franciscan frire and the other a jesuist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 2.</i>&mdash;This day is a feast in Japon, of their great profit
  or god, Shaka, whoe, as they beleeve, died a month past and rose againe
  this day, being the 8th of their month of Singuach. Whereupon they
  deck all the eaves of their howses with greene bowes, in remembrance
  of his rising from death to life. They also hold opinion that in the
  end (but they know not when) that on this day he will apeare (or com)
  unto them againe alive, much lyke to the Persians that look for the
  coming of Mortus Ely,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and
  therfore attend his coming (as that day) with great devotion and reverence
  yearly.</p>
<p>I understanding that the King of Firando was ready to departe to goe to
  Edo, I went to vizet hym and carid a present to him, viz. 1&frac14; <i>tatta</i> black
  cloth, 1&frac14; red or stamet bayes. He took it in good parte, and
  wished me, when our shipps came, to send up no goodes to Osaky or Miaco,
  untill the Emperour permitted. I answerd hym he needed not to take
  care that I would offend in that point, for I looked so neare to the
  Emperours order that I ment to have sent a man with him now to Miaco,
  about the processe I had in hand, but staid till our shiping came,
  because I would not in any sort infring the Emperours edict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 3.</i>&mdash;The king dyned at Shosque Dono his chamberlens howse,
  whoe sent to me to desire to have a pie, a roset hen, and a duck, dressed
  after our English fation, which was performed and sent to hym.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 4.</i>&mdash;Semidone sent me word we would com to our English
  howse and meete Capt. Speck, to examen the matter of those speeches
  geven out. I retorned hym answer, yt needed not his Lordship took soe
  much paines this fowle wether, but that we would com to hym; but he
  sent me word he would com to me, which he performed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> the Holland Capt. meeting hym. And Semedone brought
  in his company Torazemon Dono and Soyemon Dono, and, to conclud, denied
  all his former speeches, only he said the king took it in ill parte
  I denied to sett my hand to a letter or writing that I had sent goodes
  up to Tozayemon Dono of Sackay to sell for me, which I tould hym I
  had reason to do, for that I sent up non but sould it in Firando, yt
  being a matter against the Emperours edict to send up any thing. They
  answered I had reason, yf I sould it heare, etc. Yt seemeth Gorezano,
  our <i>jurebasso</i>, was a cheefe occation by means of his bad tong,
  geveing out false reportes; which I will requite, yf I may.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;I entring into consideration of the small respect
  this King of Firando hath of us, in comparison of that which he had
  at our first entrance into Japon, and comparing on thing with an other
  what might be thoccation, and in the end finding my consience cleare
  that I had geven no occation thereof, I wrot a lardg letter unto hym,
  openyng the discontent I had for these six months past, in respect
  of the kynde usadg we had heretofore. The coppie of which letter I
  have kept both in English and Japon tong, as I sent it to hym by Mr.
  Jno. Osterwick. Which letter he receaved in good parte, and retorned
  me a frendly answer that he held me to be his frend from the beginning
  and that my hart was true unto hym, and so should his be to me and
  the rest of thenglish nation, and that I should make no dowbt thereof;
  yet he, being ready to goe up to themperour, could not geve me satisfaction
  in all, which he would doe at his retorne, and in the mean tyme would
  take order for Miguel the <i>tico</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 6.</i>&mdash;The King of Firando departed towardes themperours
  court this day, about nowne; and I went out with a small bark and carid
  hym 2 barilles wyne and 30 loves bread, and praid God send hym a good
  voyage. The Hollanders shot affe 7 chambers or peces of ordinance as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> he passed by, but went not out to accompany hym as
  they were wont to doe.</p>
<p>There was 30 <i>cattis</i> tyn sent to the founders, to melt in our ordinance
  of copper. So we cast 2 basses, or small peeces, with chambers this
  day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 9.</i>&mdash;There is speeches geven out that the Corean embassador
  is howerly looked for at Ishew, with 500 attendantes following of hym.
  So the King of Firando hath geven order for receving of hym and apointed
  som 20 or more of the ruchest and hansomest men in the towne to accompany
  Tonoman Samme his brother as his attendantes; but at their owne charg,
  to prevent cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 11.</i>&mdash;There was news came this day of a boate of Xaxma
  which came from Langasaque and took in som 10 Japon passingers to carry
  them to Firando, amongst whome was a yewth whoe had som 2000 <i>cattis</i> tobacco,
  which might be worth som 4000 <i>mas</i>. For which (as it is thought)
  they sett on the passingers and slue 5 of them, but, being neare the
  shore on the cost of Umbra, the rest escaped and raysed the cuntrey,
  whoe took one of them presently; but the rest, being 6 or 7, escaped
  into the woodes, which forthwith were besett rownd about by the kinges
  comandement, so that they canot escape.</p>
<p>Yt is said their are many of these Xaxmas in their owne cuntrey up in
  swarmes and keepe the woodes, doing much mischeefe and comiting many
  murthers, and canot yet be suppressed. The begyners were souldiers
  which were prest to goe helpe the Emperour against Fidaia Samme (or
  at least made a shew they ment to doe soe); but they coming to late,
  he haveing no neede of them, they were dismist without pay, which caused
  them to doe as they doe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 13.</i>&mdash;I sent a letter to Jor. Durois, with a Spanish book
  called Catholico reformado.</p>
<p>And the fownders had 30 <i>cattis</i> tynne more, and cast us 2 more copper
  bases, same mold as the former.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 20.</i>&mdash;I went and viseted Taccamon Dono, the cheefe justice,
  and carid hym a present of a barill of wyne and 2 fyshes, with 2 papers
  rolls of <i>match</i>, containing in each paper 10 roles. He took it
  in good parte, and promised me to be ready to favour our nation in
  all he could.</p>
<p>Gorezano, our quandum <i>jurebasso</i>, came to me and tould me that he
  esteemed hym selfe worthy of the 36 <i>tais</i> od money he owed upon
  rest of accompt, in respect of the service he had donne us above at
  Emperours court; and in fyne tould me, yf I ment to have any thing,
  I might get it by law. Also he tould me that Shosque Dono reported
  unto hym that the Emperour had comanded Safian Dono to cut his bellie;
  but I canot beleev it to be true, for I sent to Shosque Dono to know
  whether it were so or no, and he answerd such reportes were geven out,
  but he knew not whether it were true or no.</p>
<p>The fownders had 14 <i>cattis</i> tyn to cast chambers for the 4 fowlers,
  but wanted stuff, so one rested imperfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 21.</i>&mdash;Speeches are geven out that the <i>caboques</i> or
  Japon players (or whores), going from hence for Tushma to meete the
  Corean ambassadors, were set on by the way by a boate of Xaxma theeves,
  and kild all both men and women, for the money they had gotten at Firando.</p>
<p>Bongo Same sent me a hanche of wild boare for a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 22.</i>&mdash;Jor. Durois advised me that the Kyng of Umbra had
  put two padres to death, viz. one a jesuist and the other a Franceskan
  fryre. Also that on of the murtherers was taken which kild the Japons
  in the bark, but as yet will not confes whoe were his companions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 26.</i>&mdash;We tried our 4 fowlers this day and fownd all to
  be good, only the brich of ij of the chambers of one of the bigger
  peeces were broaken by meanes of the iron fid which was badly made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 28.</i>&mdash;The Chinas rowed for wagers this day in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> boates with paddelles, som 8 or 9 on a
  side, seting up a ma[r]k in the sea, and the boate which
  came first at it got. This they doe upon duble occation;
  the Chinas houlding on origenall and the Japons an other.
  This feast begyneth the first of this month of Gonguach,
  and endeth 5th day, which is to morow, which is the cheefe
  day both with China and Japon. And this day in the mornyng
  they decked all the eaves of their howses with green flagges
  (or segges) mingled with an other green herbe, which they
  keepe all the yeare after, drying the said herbe, and make
  littell mattches to burne their bodies, legges, or armes,
  or any parte wherein they feele payne, which they doe in
  place of letting blood. I say, wheare we use to lett blood
  upon occation to sick persons, they use to burne them with
  this herbe, and esteeme that consecrated this day the best.</p>
<p>And now tuching this feast of Piro (or Pilo), the Chinas hold the origenall
  as followeth, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>They have it by record (or writing), as they say, that many ages past
  a king of China propownded a question to his sages (or wise men), comanding
  them to tell hym the truth, what thing only they esteemed the best
  and most necessary upon the earth for the sustenance of mans lyfe.
  And their were two only that stood in contention about the matter:
  the one saying that salt was the best; and the other, suger. So the
  kyng comanded to bring hym both of the on and other and made a tast
  of both; and fynding the salt so unsavery in his mouth, comanded that
  wyse man, which spook in praise thereof, to be cast into the say. But
  thereupon grew such extreme fowle wether for a long tyme afterward,
  that they had no meanes to mak salt, so that non was to be had to seazon
  or dres the kinges meate. By which meanes he fownd then by experience
  that salt was better then suger, and was sory he had soe unadvisedly
  put the other to death. And on day, as he sat at dyner, in greate care
  for want of salt, there was som fell downe upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> the table, and he knew not from whence it came. This
  miracle (they say) hapned the first day of Gonguach, soe that presently
  the king comanded a seremony to be used upon the sea, in memory of
  that man which was drownd, whose name was Piro (or Pilo), as aforsaid.
  So that, as they row, at every strok of paddell they geve, they name
  Pilo, they being answerd (all in one) with stroke of drum and bras
  bason. So that, ever since that tyme, they never wanted salt, and contynewally
  every yeare, at this tyme, use that seremony.</p>
<p>But they Japons howld it to be an other way, yet both agree in the name
  of the man. The Japons say he was a wise man and a great estronomer,
  and dwelled in an iland seperated from China, about the cost of Camboja,
  and that by his learnyng he understood before hand that the iland where
  he dwelt should sink into the sea, and tould they inhabetantes thereof,
  willing them to make provision of boates and shiping (in tyme) to carry
  them away. But they laughed hym to scorne. Yet neverthelesse he made
  provition for hym selfe in tyme, and soe escaped and came to land in
  another place, all the rest perishing when the iland sunck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>May 29.</i>&mdash;This day was their feast of Gonguach Guench or 5th
  day of 5th month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 3.</i>&mdash;Word came that a bark of the China Capt. was cast
  away, I dowbting it was she he went in for Langasaque; but it proved
  to be a wood bark of his overladen and sunk, but no people lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 4.</i>&mdash;Tozayemon Dono advized me that Safian Dono is at
  Edo and in favor, Gonrok Dono his kinsman gon for governor to Langasaque,
  and Chubio Dono his brother at bathes, all in favor, and that themperor
  will be at Miaco next month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 6.</i>&mdash;It is said two more padres or papist pristes are
  put to death in Umbra; and, because the people carid away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> the blood in handkerchefes and clowtes of the other
  two executed before, he caused these 2 to be cast into the sea, with
  stones tied about their necks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 7.</i>&mdash;Towardes night a man of Goto brought word how there
  were iij shipps arived neare to Goto and there com to an anker; but
  he knew not what they were. And about midnight Capt. Speck sent me
  word that the[y] were ij greate shipps of theares com from Molucas
  and had taken a junck on the cost of Manillias and brought her as prize
  to Japon. Also that they had 10 greate shipps at Manillias to look
  out in those partes, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;The 2 Holland ships and prize came into the roade
  at Cochy. It is said they have taken and spoiled all the junckes which
  went this yeare for the Manillias. They confes 14 or 15 sayle, but
  thought to be much more, and have burned the Spanish shipp of Don Jno.
  de Silva and others, but not knowne wether they had the treasure or
  no. It is esteemed their booty is greate. They say they have another
  junk prize which they lost company of at sea, haveing 7 Hollander men
  in her and rest Chinas above 30 or 40. So they dowbt the Chinas have
  kild them. Also reportes are geven out they have taken China junkes
  on this cost. In fine, yt is thought they will have trowble about taking
  Chinas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 9.</i>&mdash;I went abord the ij Holland shipps to Cochy, and
  carid each of them a barell of wyne, a hogg, and 10 loves bread. I
  thought to have fownd Capt. Speck abord, but he was gon ashore; and
  the King of Firando had set a bark to watch that nothing was brought
  ashore. So it is thought the Hollanders will not let their shipps nor
  priz junk enter into Firando, for it is said they have robbed above
  40 junkes, and are both full laden with silk and stuffes of silk, and
  the priz 200 <i>picolles</i> silk abord her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 10.</i>&mdash;The Holland marreners came ashore unknowne to the
  master, and brought taffetes, sattens, damasks, muscods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> and such lyke, geving away and selling matters good
  cheape. The master and capt. of both Holland shipps came ashore and
  went with Capt. Speck to vizet the kinges brother, and from thence
  came all to thenglish howse. Capt. Speck tould me that the kinges brother
  had warned them not to sell anything till they heard answer from themperour,
  but might land what they would. So this day they loaded 4 or 5 barkes
  with raw silk and sent it ashore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 11.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. took a boate and went to see the
  junk that the Hollanders took, wherat Capt. Speck was much offended
  and would not let hym goe abord. Yet he spok to the Chinas, whoe tould
  hym they shewed great cruelty to them, and were not content to take
  shipp and goodes but cast them overbord, for of 270 persons that were
  abord that junck they had left but 30; and, when they had taken all
  that they liked out of other junkes, they sunk them with the rest,
  people and all. Soe he hath taken councell with the Chinas to send
  up to the Emperour to make complaint; and in the meane tyme hath sent
  for Gonrok Dono, to Langasaque, to com hether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;I wrot 3 letters to Tozayemon Dono of Sackay, Cuimon
  Dono of Osaky, and Magozemon Dono of Miaco, advising them of the arivall
  of the ij Holland shipps with their priz, and delivered them to Soyemon
  Dono to send up in the kinges bark which now they send up about Hollanders
  matter, per which conveance the Chinas send to have remedy against
  the Hollanders.</p>
<p>These Chinas in the junck will not be perswaded but that they are Englishmen
  which took them. The reason, the Hollanders in all their theevish proceadinges
  geve it out they are English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 13.</i>&mdash;Capt. Speck receved a letter that their other junk
  the[y] lost in the way was arived in Xaxma. The Hollanders sett out
  orders abord their shipps that the mareners should sell nothing to
  the Englishmen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 14.</i>&mdash;I receved a letter from Alvaro Munos, which Capt.
  Speck opened before it came to my handes, of the which I wrot hym a
  letter that I took it in ill parte.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 17.</i>&mdash;I sent Henry Shank iij <i>tais</i> small plate upon
  a bundell silk in pawne, to pay (as he saith) for stuffes he hath bought
  of Hollanders. This Shank I fynd to be a busye, humerous pot companion.</p>
<p>Mr. Totton, being envited by some of the Hollanders to goe abord to make
  merry, took a bark and thought to have donne it; but, being ready to
  goe abord, Ushenusque Dono comanded the Japons which carid hym to retorne
  back, except he brought a ticket from the Hollanders. Whereupon they
  would not be perswaded by any meanes to set them abord. So at his retorne
  we thought to have provided hym an English ging to row hym abord; but
  the tide was past, that they could not, and so it rested till the morow
  mornyng.</p>
<p>Harry Shank is a quarrellsom, drunken fello, and not many dais past entertayned
  a wench, although I perswaded hym to the contrary, and after threw
  her out at a windoe in an upper loft and put her away in bad sort.
  Yet this day he got a dagger in his pocket, and went to her fathers
  howse, using hym with bad tearmes to provok hym to com out, and then
  wounded hym in 3 places; so that all the street was in an upror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 18.</i>&mdash;This mornyng Mr. Totton went abord the Hollanders,
  rowed in our owne boate all by Englishmen, to see whether the Hollanders
  would forbid hym entrance; and withall I wrot a letter to Ushenusque
  Dono, or such <i>bongew</i> as was theare, to geve hym to understand
  I took the Hollanders no kinges in Japon that I should seek a passe
  from them, willing hym withall to take heed how he medled in matters
  which tuched our previleges, as he would answer to the contrary before
  the Emperour and the King of Firando, his master, my preveleges alowing
  me free passag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> both by sea and land, to doe my busenes without disturbance
  of Japon or any other in Firando or Langasaque.</p>
<p>Mr. Totton was frendly entertayned abord by Capt. Speck and the rest of
  Hollanders, and tould hym that it were the Japons that forbad our coming
  abord and not he, and that I had good occation to be angry, yf he should
  set out any order to forbid thenglish to com abord. And for my letter
  which was opened, he made many protestations it was against his will,
  he, being busy and the letter brought unto hym, opened it unawares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 19.</i>&mdash;This mornyng fayre wether, wynd northerly but rack
  easterly, and sowne after rayne most parte of the day, with much wynd
  as abovesaid, and in the night proved a tuffon, or extreme storm of
  wynd and rayne, blowing downe or uncovering howses and sincking boates,
  and amongst the rest our <i>foyfone</i>.</p>
<p>Also in the affter nowne our host Cuemon Dono of Osaky arived heare at
  Firando and brought me a present of ij <i>catabras</i>, one of silk
  and thother lynen, with ij littell packetes fyne rise, and a wyre frame
  for a <i>sequanseky</i><a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> or
  cupp. Yt is said the King of Xaxma hath sufferd the Chinas to land
  all ther goodes out of the junk the Hollanders took, not medling with
  the one partie nor the other. And the Chinas make a purse amongst them
  all of 5000 <i>tais</i> to send in a present to themperour to have
  redresse against the Hollanders.</p>
<p>This night the tuffon (or storme) drove the 2 Holland shipps agrownd with
  the junk they took prize, and, as it is said, are all 3 bildged and
  all the merchandiz wett that is in them. Many men speak diversly of
  the matter, but most say playnly it is a ponishment of God upon the
  Hollanders for wrongfully taking of other mens goodes. Howsoever the
  losse will be infynet, all being wet, and now must land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> that perfnerce which they thought should never com
  ashore in Japon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 20.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Osterwick to Capt. Speck to tell hym
  I was sory for the misfortune happened, offring them any help we could.
  He desired to have our <i>foy fone</i>, which was sunk this night,
  to helpe them; which we sowne cleared and made her ready with 14 ores
  to row and one of our <i>jurebassos</i>, and so sent her to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 21.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter complementall to Gonroq Dono, that
  I was glad of his arivall at Langasaque, as also tuching my processe
  against the scrivano of Giquans junk, with other matters, as apereth
  per coppie, in the Japon tong. And I wrot an other to Capt. Whow, the
  China Capt. at Langasaque, and sent hym all the papers of my processe
  against the said scrivano.</p>
<p>And in thaftar nowne Gonrok Donos man came to our English howse, and tould
  me he was sent per his master to accompany certen Spaniardes and Portingales,
  to signefie to the <i>Tono</i> of Firando that he should not suffer
  the Hollanders to let any of their shiping go it (<i>sic</i>) to lay
  waite for thamakan shipp, as they gave it out they would doe, as also
  to comand the Hollandes Capt. in themperours name that he should se
  it performed. Yet, as it falls out, they needed not to have taken soe
  much paines, for God had prevented their desines and brought their
  shiping on grownd, and bildged and broaken her to peeces which should
  have gon out. Also the China Capt. tould me that the King of Xaxma
  had secretly geven leave to the Chinas that were in the Hollandes junk
  of priz, put into that place, that perforce they might discharg their
  goodes against the Hollanders wills, which were but few, and then pursue
  law against them at themperours Court; which they have donne. And this
  mornyng the China Capt. sent one of his servantes to the <i>bongews</i> which
  saw the unlading of the goodes out of the China junk, to know wheare
  the goodes were put,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> either into the Hollande howse or the kinges gedong.
  But he retorned answer he knew not where they were put. In fine, it
  is thought the Hollanders will fall into greate trowble about these
  busynesses, and som in this place into danger for permiting matters
  to passe as they doe.</p>
<p>The Spaniardes and Portingale come to towne were Alvaro Munos, Lues Martin,
  and one Farnandes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 22.</i>&mdash;The Hollanders gott one of there shipps called the <i>Flushing</i> aflote,
  and hath not much hurte, as they say, besides the cuting overbord of
  the mast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 24.</i>&mdash;The Hollanders men remeaned ashore, day and night,
  notwithstanding the danger their shipping and goodes were falne into
  per meanes of this tuffon past. So Albartus, Leonard, and Jacob Swager,
  accompanid with Japons, went to ferret them out of their whorehouses.
  And som they took, and others escaped into the woodes, after whome
  they sent Japons to hunt them out, geveing them five <i>mas</i> or
  halfe a crowne str. for each one they brought, which was not long a
  doing, they being carid along the streetes with their handes bownd
  behind them and garded to the Duch howse lyke theeves; and surly I
  esteemed them worse, that would leave their shipps in such danger,
  som of them never going abord since the shipps came into harbor.</p>
<p>Our host Cuemon Dono of Osaky came and vizeted me and brought me a present
  of a <i>barso</i> of Mywarey wyne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 25.</i>&mdash;The Hollanders sought for a caffro which had stolne
  thinges from abord, and fownd hym and carid hym abord in bandes. Also
  there were souldiers which were unruly ashore and would not keepe quarter
  abord, nether cared for mareners, master, nor other, till their lieutenant
  soldier came to look them out and carid them abord in bandes.</p>
<p>I envited Cuimon Dono, our host of Osaky, to dyner, <i>nifon catange</i> (or
  Japon fation), with an other of Osaky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> which was in his company, and their host of Firando;
  and by chance Alvaro Munos came at same tyme and dyned with us. This
  is a suttell Castillano and a tyme observer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 26.</i>&mdash;News is com to towne that 3 more of the Hollander
  men of war that fought with the Spaniardes at Manillas are without,
  at an iland neare unto Langasaque, called Nomozaky. And sowne after
  the master of the <i>Flushing</i> came ashore to the English howse,
  and tould me that 2 of these shipps which are com in are of Bantam.
  I say that 2 of these Holland shipps came from Bantam and the therd
  from the Manillias; in which shipp is com Jno. Derickson Lamb, generall
  of the fleet which came from the Manillias and fought with the Spaniardes.
  And now they say that the ambrall<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> shipp
  of the Hollanders is lost in that fight with 2 others, and that 5 Spaniardes
  were sunck. But it is uncerten whether it will prove true or no, for
  that the Hollanders differ soe much in reportes.</p>
<p>Yt is also said that Capt. Speck gave adviz formerly for these 2 shipps
  which are com from Bantam to com of purpose to take the Macon shipp,
  and so to carry tymber and other provisions from hence for Molucos,
  yf they missed of their purpose.</p>
<p>They report that news was com out of England for Bantam that the Spanish
  ambassador was taken or kept prisoner in England for treason pretended
  against the Kinges Majestie and state, and that the Kinges Majestie
  of England had set out his army royall against the Spaniardes; which
  whether it will prove true or no I know not.</p>
<p>Mr. Nealson, being drunk yisternight (as he is seldom sober), fell a quarreling
  with Mr. Totton and used hym out of fation; and because I reproved
  hym for it, willing hym to goe into his chamber and sleepe, he fell
  out with me and cald me ould drunken asse, geveing me many thretnyng
  speeches not sufferable, as Mr. Totton, Mr. Osterwick, and all the
  rest are witnesse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 27.</i>&mdash;Mr. Nealson wrot me he was sory of that which passed
  yesternight, promesing amendment; which God grant.</p>
<p>Mr. Totton and Mr. Osterwick went abord the Holland shipps, being therunto
  envited per the masters; but Uchenusque Dono, being <i>bongew</i>,
  sent men to take their ores from them, as they did the lyke from Jno.
  Cooke and the chirurgion, with certen peeces stuff was geven them for
  presentes; but after, they better bethought them selves and retorned
  all. Yt is strang to see how we are misused by these Japons of Firando,
  and how that theefe Gorezano is mentayned to misuse us; and the justice
  will not compell hym to pay me that he oweth me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 28.</i>&mdash;About nowne came news that the Amacan ship is arived
  at Langasaque, as also a junck of the China Capten, com from Isla Fermosa,
  called by them Taccasanga. Also they bring word that the Hollanders
  which com from Bantam say that we have 2 shipps to com for these partes.
  God send them well in.</p>
<p>Before night there was letters came to Capt. China from Langasaque, that
  it is but a small friggat of adviz which is com from Amacan to Langasaque,
  and brought but littell goodes.</p>
<p>The steward of the Duch shipp <i>Red Lyon</i>, coming ashore with certen
  stuffes to make aparell for the master and others, to the vallue of
  50 R. of 8, it was all taken from hym per the Japon <i>bongews</i>,
  and he wounded in the head because he made resistance. I know not what
  the mallapertnes of these Japons should be to forestall men for making
  use of their owne, except it be they think to mak booty of all, yf
  themperour favor not the Hollanders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 29.</i>&mdash;The other 3 Holland shipps enterd into the bay of
  Cochy yisternight very late, and the <i>Flushing</i> shot affe 3 peces
  ordinance for a welcom, but they answered with non. These 3 which now
  entred are the ould <i>Son</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> wherin Jno. Derickson Lamb, the generall, is com from
  the Manillas, and the other ij came from Bantam, the on called the <i>Black
  Lyon</i>, she which was heare the last yeare.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck retorned ashore yisternight, he haveing byn out 4 or 5 daies
  abord these new com shipps, and, as it is said, was at Langasaque to
  speake with Gonrok Dono, whoe, hearing of the arivall of the Amacan
  ship, comanded hym in themperours name to retyre to Firando with their
  3 new com shipps, according as themperour had ordayned, to thentent
  the Macon shipp might enter without empechment. Soe the Hollanders
  wayed ancor to com for this place; and sowne after, in sight of them,
  the Portingall shipp entred the port of Langasaque.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how Mr. Nealson went abord the ij Hollandes shipps,
  but was noe sowner abord but the Japon <i>bongews</i> sent to take
  away both boate and ores; which he seeing, stepped into the boate and
  bad them stand back or enter upon their parell. So they returned grumbling,
  thretnyng the Japons which carid us.</p>
<p>About dyner time I was enformed that the junck, which Shobi Dono should
  have brought our 5000 skins in the other yeare from Syam, is now arived
  at Langasaque, and that she wintered in Champan,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and
  from thence came this yeare. Soe I presently dispached Mr. Nealson
  for Langasaque with 1 bill for 5000 skins, wherof 440 for Andrea Dittis,
  each to pay 24 skins per cento. fraight; 1 bill of 492 <i>tais</i> Japon
  plate, to be paid per Shobio Dono within 30 daies after his arivall
  at Langasaque.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>June 30.</i>&mdash;I went and vizeted the Holland generall named Jno.
  Derickson Lamb, and carid hym 2 <i>barsos</i> wyne, a hogg, 20 loves
  fresh bread, and 5 hense; and to the capt. of the other ii shipps each
  one a <i>barso</i> wyne, a hog, and 20 loves bread. Yt was taken in
  good part. I doe perceve by the generall that in the battell they sunk
  no Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> shipp, but that iij Hollanders were sunk, viz. the
  admerall, called the <i>New Son</i>, and a lesser shipp and a small
  peenisse, all the men perishing out of the ij lesser, but saved them
  which were in the admerall that were left alive, shee being ready to
  sinke. But the viz-admerall, meeting with the other 2 Holland shipps,
  burnt her selfe, as I have formerly noted, as also they burned the
  shipp which went the last yeare from Xaxma with the treasure which
  came from New Spaine to the vallue of 6 millions; but the money was
  landed before.</p>
<p>I can heare of no letters they brought for us; only they say the small
  shipp, which went from hence, was making ready to com back, but can
  tell nothing of Capt. Keeling, whether he be gon for England or for
  the Molucas. They allso say the English Capt. at Bantam is dead, but
  know not his name. Some yet said it was Capt. Jourden, and others said
  he was gon for England, and he dead that was left in his place. They
  also report that the <i>Hector</i> was cast away at Surat, for falt
  of looking to in carynyng.</p>
<p>The ij Duch shipps which came from Bantam did tuch at Pattania, and say
  there was but ij Englishmen theare, Mr. Browne and a yowth. Also yt
  was tould them that Mr. Benjamyn Farry was dead at Syam. And they say
  there was ij French shipps this yeare at Bantam, but came without money
  and so could doe nothing. Their pilottes were Hollanders, which the
  Hollanders at Bantam took out of them per force, us they did the like
  per all other Hollanders they found in them. They say there is iij
  other French shipps coming after to second them, which, yf they speed
  no better then these, will not geve the adventurers curadge to send
  any more.</p>
<p>These Hollanders report very strang newes out of England of treason pretended
  against the Kinges person, wherin the quandum Countes of Essex, that
  was marid to the Earle of Somercet, should have a hand, as also be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> a contriver of the death of Prince Henry. In fine they
  tell strange matters.</p>
<p>There were 4 or 5 English men abord the <i>Son</i>, the admerall shipp
  of the Hollanders, which, as it seemed, were afraid to make them selves
  knowne unto me; and one of them, a talle fello, stood staring as yf
  he had byn agast, and tould me he was dowbtfull whether he might tell
  me he was an English man or no. It hath made me to enter into many
  imagenations of the speeches of killing our English men at Pulaway
  and taking it from our English nation, whome had pocession of it before
  for the Kinges Ma<sup>tie</sup> of England. Also of the poisonyng of
  Capt. Castelton, which they put upon the Spaniardes; yet may and is
  dowbted over much by the familliarety betwix hym and Jno. Derickson
  Lamb, the Hollandes generall.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 1.</i>&mdash;Skydayon Dono, capt. of our junck <i>Sea Adventure</i>,
  wrot a letter to his brother, which letter came per junck of Shoby
  Dono from Champan, wherin he advized hym how our junk <i>Sea Adventure</i> made
  her voyage from hence to Syam in 28 dayes. God send her safely to retorne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;Gonrok Dono sent his man to Capt. Speck with a present
  of 2 peare <i>beawbs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The <i>beawbs</i> were
  sent to Jno. Derickson Lamb.</p>
<p>I understood Jno. Derickson Lamb would bring in his shipp this day, wherupon
  I sent our <i>foyfony</i> with 14 ores to helpe to toe her in; but
  she came not in, but the lesser shipp called the <i>Gallyasse</i>.
  I sent Richard Kyng in the <i>foyfony</i>, because he spoke Duch; and
  it fortuned the Englishmen fownd opertunety to tell hym they asked
  the generall leave to com ashore, to vizet their cuntreymen. But he
  reprooved them, saying they held the English in these partes for their
  mortall enemies, and therefore forbad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> them to com to our howse. This unfrendly dealing doth
  still conferme me in my former opinion that they have slayne our men
  in the Molucas. God grant they have not used som trechery against Generall
  Keeling. And at this instant came a drunken Flemyng to our English
  howse, whoe tould me they were forbidden upon payne of their lives
  to com to the English howse, &ldquo;yet&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;I will
  com to yow, and were I out of the Hollanders service I would never
  serve them more&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 3.</i>&mdash;I went and viseted Tonomon Samme, the kinges brother,
  and carid hym 2 <i>barsos</i> wyne and 2 cordes drid fyshes, exskewsing
  my not coming before since his brothers departure. He asked me whie
  we did not take China junkes, as well as the Hollanders. I answerd
  hym we could not take any that were frendes to the King of England,
  as the Chinas weare and all others till wars were procleamed. He also
  asked me whether we would take Spaniardes or Portingall shipps, yf
  we met them. I answerd hym that we had more reason to doe that then
  to take Chinas, for that they did take ours, yf they had strength to
  doe it.
  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think the Emperour will not permit
  the one nor the other to meddell with the shipp of Amacon.&rdquo;
  I tould hym I thought to the contrary, that the Emperour would rather
  permit us to take Spaniardes then Chinas, for, yf we took them, we
  would bring them in heare. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
  said he, &ldquo;yf yow had taken her this yeare, yow might well have
  brought her in. But how should we doe hereafter, yf yow debar us from
  that continuall trade?&rdquo;  I answerd we should not want to bring
  in yearly the lyke comodetie either from one place or other.</p>
<p>He tould me that he had noted a long tyme that the Hollanders and we were
  frendes but from tooth outward and not cordially, as neighbours and
  frendes ought to be. I answerd hym the falt was not ours but the pride
  of the other, which would make the world to beleeve they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> that which they were not. For that it was well knowne
  there was no comparison to be made betwixt their small state, governed
  by a county, with the mighty and powrefull government of the King of
  England, whoe did in som sort governe them, keeping garrisons in their
  cheefest places.</p>
<p>I also tould hym I marveled that the Firando <i>bongews</i> the other
  day did take the ores out of the boates which carid us abord the Holland
  shipps, with such peeces of stuffes as were geven our folkes to make
  them aparell. He answerd me he knew nothing thereof, only order was
  geven by Taccamon Dono to restreigne all men from buying till order
  came from themperour what was to be donne therein. I asked hym then
  by what authorety Gorezano was suffered to buy and to goe up and downe
  in the shipps with greate bagges of money, to buy and doe what hee
  list; which speech put hym to a non plus that he knew not what to say.
  In fine, I tould hym that I had a processe against this Goresano for
  money he owed me, and had required justice long ago, and put my papers
  into Taccamon Donos handes, but could have no end thereof, only now
  I desird hym that seeing this fello had money to build howses and buy
  merchandiz, that he might be constrayned to pay me that which he oweth.
  He answerd me he would speake to Taccamon Dono to doe me justice.</p>
<p>There came 2 Japons to the English howse, which came in these Duch shipps,
  and complaine that the Hollanders will not pay them their wagis according
  to promis, and desired, when our shiping came, yf we had need of men,
  that they might be entertayned, for that they would not serve the Hollanders
  any more, haveing byn soe badly dealt with for their 6 yeares servis
  now past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 4.</i>&mdash;The admerall ship of the Hollanders, called the <i>Sone</i>,
  came into Firando road this day, and shot afe 7 peces ordinance, and
  4 we[re] shot out of the <i>Gallias</i> and certen chambers from Duch
  howse. I sent Mr. Osterwick abord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> to bid the generall, Jno. Derickson Lamb, welcom, and
  sent hym by hym 2 peare silk stockinges for a present, viz. one crimson,
  and thother sad blew, which he took in good parte, telling Mr. Osterwick
  he would com and vizet me at our English howse.</p>
<p>Towardes night Mr. Nealson arived from Langasaque, and brought the 3800
  skins along with hym, as also a letter from Mr. Wm. Eaton, dated in
  Syam, le 28th February, 1616, but kept till 13th March, and sent per
  way Champa.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Benjamyn Farry in Judea,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> at
  Syam, 1th June, 1616.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Jno. Johnson and Mr. Ric (?) Pitt in Judea, 13th Marche, 1616.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. James Burges, pilot of <i>Sea Adventure</i>, 16 Marche, 1616.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Jno. Ferrers, at Paria in Champa, 18 May, 1617.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Robt. Burges, ditto Champa, without date.</p>
<p>All which letters came in the junk Shoby Dono from Champa, som of them
  being sent in a small <i>soma</i> from Syam to Champa, with a cargezon
  goodes amonting to 680 <i>tais</i>, under charg of Piter Hall, Jno.
  Ferrers, and Robt. Burges for pilot. God send us good news of them
  hereafter, for they advize a Portugall frigat took the Hollandes bark
  going out to retorne for Syam. They advize both from Syam and Champa,
  as also from Camboja, that the kinges of those places, as also of Cochinchina,
  desire much to have our shipping to trade into their cuntres, espetially
  he of Cochinchina, but to com in our owne shiping, and not in Japons,
  for that he hath banished them out of his cuntrey, I meane the renegages
  enhabeting in those partes, which did all the mischeefe before.</p>
<p>I receved a letter from Jor. Durois, of 12th July, in Langasaque, wherin
  he adviseth of 20 Spanish gallions arived this yeare in the Indies
  at Malacca, viz. 12 Spanish and 8 Portugeze, with order to roote out
  all Hollanders at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> Bantam, Molucos, and else wheare, and not to let one
  remeane alive. God grant it prove falce and confownd them in their
  proceadinges. This news he sayeth cometh from the Manillas, and that
  the Spaniardes chased away the Hollanders from thence with losse of
  3 Hollande shipps and no Spaniardes; which is a lye, and so I hope
  the rest may prove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 5.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Osterwick to tell Capt. Speck the newes
  we heard of the takeing a bark or boate of theirs on the bar of Champa
  by a Portingale friggat, as also what Jor. Durois had wrot me of the
  20 gallions arived at Malacca. But he skarce did vouchsafe to open
  his lipps unto hym or look at hym, but sent to know what he had to
  say. At the same tyme Jno. Derckson Lamb was by, and som 50 or 60 small
  shot plying their muskets before hym, he walking in state with a greate
  cheane of gould 4 fould about his neck, and had sentenelles of musketers
  standing in each quarter of the howse, with musket in rest and mach
  in cock; but whether they did it to shew greatnesse, or for feare to
  be supprised (their consciences accusing them), I know not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 6.</i>&mdash;The Duch domine came to the English howse, and, as
  I perceaved by his speech, he was aware of w[rong] amo[ng]st them,
  saying they had not the feare of God before their eyes, and therefore
  could not be happey in their proceadinges. And sowne after came the
  fiscall, unto whome I showed my adviz (or letter) I had receaved of
  the 20 seale Spanish gallions arived at Malacca. He said it should
  be strange yf such a strength should com at once out of Spaine, without
  being seconded per the Hollanders, who no dowbt would not want to have
  a care thereof; and did verely think that their Company and the English
  weare all joyned in one before now, for that the difference, being
  but a money matter, could not chuse but sowne be decyded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> Yt should seeme their is but littell good will between
  this fiskall and Capt. Speck.</p>
<p>Yt is strang to see the unrulynes of these Hollande mareners and souldiers,
  how they goe stagring drunk up and downe the streetes, slashing and
  cutting ofe each other with their knyves, lyke mad men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 7.</i>&mdash;This day Mr. Totton had much conference with an English
  man which came in the Hollande shipps, and did what he could to learne
  out whether the Hollanders had kild our English men at Pulaway in the
  Molucos. This fello was loath to say any thing, yet in the end he confessed
  that he had heard others report that we had 5 or 7 English men in that
  iland, and had taken a howse a littell up within the cuntrey, and planted
  the English flag on the hiest parte thereof; which coming to knowledg
  of Jno. Dirickson Lamb, the Hollande generall, he sent for them to
  come downe to hym, which the English men denied to doe, retornyng hym
  word they had taken pocession of that place for the King of England,
  and that they would keepe it and mentayne it to the last drop of blood
  they had in their bodies; which the Hollander perceaving sent a multitude
  of Molucan people to take them perforce and to bring them to hym alive
  or dead; which was performed and 2 English men seene brought downe,
  bownd hand and foote, by that raskall rable; but what became of the
  rest this man knew not. Thus much have I noted downe, that, whether
  I live or dye, yet I hope this my hand writing may com to the handes
  of our honorable employers, and that our gratious soveraigne, King
  James, will not let his subjectes be murthered and his pocessions taken
  from hym in such sort.</p>
<p>And we sould the rest of our ellophantes teeth to Shroyemon Dono at 70 <i>tais
  picull</i>, waying 619 <i>cattis</i>; and were waid out unto
  hym this day.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how thenglishman tould us that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> when the mutenous Hollanders and their
  consortes had kild our Englishmen at Poolaway and brought
  downe our English flag, the drunken, envious Hollanders
  (brave men) puld it in peeces and dru it thorow ... and
  made cleane ... with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 8.</i>&mdash;I thought good to note downe heare how Taccamon Dono
  sent to know what our ellophantes teeth waid and the price we sould
  them for, and to see the money we rec. for them. And I retorned hym
  word I would not let hym know nether the one nor other. I know not
  what this should meane, except they thinke to have som advantage against
  the Hollanders, and imagin to make their case and ours all one. Yet
  my comfort is, they shall never prove we have theeve stolne goodes,
  and therefore not to geve accompt to them of what we have.</p>
<p>Also the servant of Tonomon Samme came and shewed me a letter which he
  had rec. from Gonrok, that yf any poulder or lead came in Hollanders
  or English shipping, to keepe it for themperour. I tould hym he might
  have put the English before the Hollander, for it was his place, and
  for the rest, what we had was at themperoures service, as reason would
  it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 9.</i>&mdash;Capt. Speck, accompanid with Jno. Yoosen and Albartus,
  came to our English howse, and amongst other matters asked me what
  new and how those people used us. I answerd hym it was no news to tell
  hym how we are misused, and that I fownd it every day worse then other.
  He tould me it was imposseble any others were soe misused as they,
  for that the Japons kept watch and ward about their howse and about
  their shipps, and would not let the neighbours enter into their howse,
  nor suffer the cuntry people to sell them provision of victuelles nor
  lett them have a boate and people to cary Jno. Yoosen to Langasaque.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 10.</i>&mdash;I forgot to note downe that yesterday, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> after nowne, the servant of Gonrok Dodo
  came to the howse of Tome Dono, our next neighbour, a Japon
  papist, and called secretly to hym both our <i>jurebassos</i>,
  with Domingo, my boy, and there made them all drunk, I
  know not to what end, except it were to learne of them
  what speeches passed in our howse.</p>
<p>News was brought the China Capt. of a junk from Syam arived at Langasaque,
  which came in company of 5 which came from thence, but lost company
  after they passed Isla Fermosa (or Tacca Sanga). God send them well.</p>
<p>The Holland generall, Jno. Derekson Lamb, sent me a present of a <i>barica</i> Spanish
  wyne, 3 Holland cheeses, ij baskettes suger candy, and 6 gammons China
  bacon; and sent it by an English souldier, a gentelmans sonne in the
  west cuntrey.</p>
<p>Ushenusque Dono came to vizet me with many fayre wordes, unto whome I
  did in som sort tell how we were worse used then in tyme of Foyne Samme.
  He said I had reason soe to say, yet we must consider the government
  was otherwais now in Japon then it was in the tyme of Ogosho Samme,
  for that the <i>tonos</i> in Japon would not be comanded in such sort
  by Shongo Samme as they were by Ogosho [Samme]. These speeches of his
  were strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 11.</i>&mdash;Soyemon Dono came this day to vizet me, and amongst
  other speeches I tould hym it was strange to see how both we and the
  Hollanders were used now in respect of tyme past. He said that, for
  us, he knew not any thing whereby we should be misused; but for the
  Hollanders, they had brought much stolne goodes, and the <i>tono</i> of
  this place had great reazon to look unto their proceadinges till order
  came from the Emperour for the disposing thereof. Yet, at first entring
  of the ij Holland shipps and junk, the kynges brother offerd to take
  the matter in hand and to councell them for the best, and to certefy
  the Emperour yt was Portingalles goodes. At which his offer Capt. Speck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> lawghed, seting light by his speeches, geving hym bad
  tearmes. Whereupon he hath ever since held this strickt course for
  his owne discharg, and advised the Emperour that all which came in
  their shipps and junk is Chinas goodes, taken from them per force,
  which he thinkes the Emperour will not suffer any stranger take; and
  brought in for a presedent how, in Ticus Samas tyme, when the Japons
  had wars against Corea and China, that certen Japons went on the China
  cost, robing and spoiling without themperours comision, geting greate
  ruches, but at their retorne were all put to death and the goodes confiscat
  into the Emperours handes, parte being retorned to Chinas which [could
  lay] claime unto it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 12.</i>&mdash;Yisternight late I receaved a letter from Jor. Durois,
  per Fachemon, dated in Langasaque, 16th July, new stile, wherin he
  advised me of the entry of a friggat at Langasaque, which came from
  Goa and tuched at Amaccu; but writ of no newse. Also that 3 barkes
  of Twans are retorned, which were sent out to have taken Taccasango
  (or Isla Fermosa), but could effect nothing, yet were put into Cochinchina,
  where they saw Capt. Adames junk and others labouring to get straight,
  but thought would not retorne full laden. This he writes.</p>
<p>Jno. Derickson Lamb, the Hollande generall, came to our English howse,
  and Capt. Speck with the rest of the principall Hollanders did accompany
  hym. I gave hym the best entertaynment I could, and, as it seemed,
  to his and the restes content.</p>
<p>And I forgot to note downe that ij or 3 daies past divers Hollanders did
  sue unto me to get other prisoners pardon, thinking I might doe as
  much for them as I had donne for others before. Soe this day, amongst
  other conferrence, I gave hym thanks for the honor he did me in releasing
  or pardoning those offenders at my being abord, I being ashamed to
  make sute for any others, although som had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> entreated me thereunto; yet I desyred Capt. Speck and
  the rest of the company to speake to the generall in their behalves.
  In fine, they said nether yea nor no; yet rather made shew to encline
  to my request. I gave an item to Capt. Speck, and he cald to generall
  to heare it, that I was enformed to (<i>sic</i>) Spaniards went about
  to soborne their men to run away, and that, yf they took not good heed,
  they [would] want men to cary away their shipps, and th[at it is] in
  my opinion not good to use over much p[unishment] for light offences
  comited per meanes of drunke[nness]. Yt seems they took my adviz in
  good parte.</p>
<p>Soyemon Dono forestald the bay with netts, and made a fyshing just over
  against our English howse, and sent me a dish of fysh; and I retornd
  thanks, with a bottell Spanish wyne and a littell conserves. Soe, presently
  after, he sent to envite me and the rest English to supper, where,
  amongst other speeches, I asked them what they thought of this busynes
  of the Hollanders; and they are of opinion it will not be ended in
  1 yeare nor yet in 2, and that the Emperour will hould pocession. This
  they reported, and the rather because answer of the letter sent to
  themperour about that matter were retornd this day, but noe order that
  the Hollanders should enjoy that which they have taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 13.</i>&mdash;The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, retorned from Langasaque
  yisternight in all hast, to send up new replies to the Cort to enforme
  against Hollanders. The <i>Tono</i> of Firando sent me a letter from
  Miaco with ij <i>catabras</i> for a present. His desire was to have
  had all our ellophants teeth, and that he sent money to pay for them;
  but all the teeth were sould to Shroyemon Dono before.</p>
<p>There is a China com from Camboia whoe tells me that it is true the Portingale
  frigot hath taken a boate (or <i>somo</i>), laden with goods for the
  Englishmen and bound for Pattania wherin were iij Englishmen, whome
  they put all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[
  279]</a></span> death; and that there was good store ready money in
  our said <i>soma</i>. Which news coming to the eares of the Kyng of
  Camboia, he forthwith banished all the Portingales out of his cuntrey,
  and sent out 7 or 8 carecoles (or boates) well armed to have taken
  the Portingale frigat, but could not meete with them. But serten Japon
  fugeties, which are thought to be of them which were formerly banished
  out of Cochinchina, did joyne with the said Portingales; whereupon
  the Kyng of Camboia hath lykwaies banished all Japons out of his cuntrey.
  Thus much this China reporteth to be true. He sayeth ferther that ij
  Portingale fryres, of them which were lately banished out of Japon,
  had lykewaies setled them selves in Camboia, but are banished amongst
  the rest.</p>
<p>The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, gave me a China seame (or draught nett),
  and I gave hym 2 lynen <i>catabras</i>.</p>
<p>Many Holland mareners came to thenglish howse, complayning how they were
  misused and beaten lyke boyes without forme or reason. Yt is dowbtfull
  many will run away in the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 14.</i>&mdash;I rec. a letter from Magazemon Dono, our host of
  Miaco, with a box and 20 ordenary fans, for a present, in it. Also
  an other from the <i>maky</i> dono, with 3 boxes or chistes <i>maky</i> ware,
  which were opened, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">In one chist, 20 tankards.</p>
<p class="blockquot">In an other, 20 large spoote pottes.</p>
<p class="blockquot">In an other, 20 lesser spoote pottes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 15.</i>&mdash;Alvaro Munos came this mornynge and tould me that
  the Portingals had taken no English men but Hollanders on the cost
  of Camboia, and, as I am enformed, went to the Hollanders and tould
  them it were English which were taken.</p>
<p>Also Gonrok Dono sent the scrivano I have the plito withall to this place,
  he haveng tould hym that I had receved all the dead Chinas goodes from
  hym, soe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[
  280]</a></span> matter might be brought in question before the justis
  of this place. So now I hope this lying theefe shall have his disertes,
  for I have not receved any such matters.</p>
<p><i>July 16.</i>&mdash;The Hollande fiscall came to vizet me, exskewsing
  hym selfe he came not in company of the generall, his busynes being
  such as he could not, with many other complementall words. He tould
  me of the extreme justis they had showed to the trumpeter and an other
  in beating them allmost dead. I answerd hym that it were not good,
  in my opinion, to use over much rigor in punishing drunken men; for
  it was not they, but the wyne which was occation therof; yet I denid
  not but such justis was fit to be used aganst hainose offenders. In
  fine, we had some speeches tuching their busynes against the Chinas;
  and he said that, yf themperour did not lett them quietly pocesse that
  which they had taken, they would take Japons as well as others the
  next yeare.</p>
<p><i>July 17.</i>&mdash;I sent Mr. Osterwick, with a <i>jurebasso</i>, to
  Tonomon Samme about my processe against the scrivano of Giquans junk;
  and he said he would take councell about it and doe me justice, and
  that, yf he had knowne of the matter before, he would have ended it.
  But these are but wordes, for I had long before enformed hym of it,
  and he turned me over to Taccamon Dono, who, as I have formerly noted,
  would nether doe me justice in that matter, nor in any other which
  from tyme to tyme I have brought before hym.</p>
<p>An ould Frenchman of 70 yeares ould, of Marselles, came to thenglish howse
  this day and tould me he had served the Spaniardes in the Manilles
  11 yeares, and the last yeare went with Don Jno. de Silva to Malacca,
  and from thence was sent in company of 1 galley and 3 friggates to
  sucker the Spaniardes at Molucas, and there (upon som occation of discontent)
  fled to the Hollanders, and came in their fleet this yeare to the Manillias,
  showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> them
  all the portes and places where shipping might enter, doing them better
  servis for that place then any other which was in their fleet could
  doe. And was in the Holland admerall shipp when she was soonk, where
  he lost all that ever he had but the cloathes on his back. And now,
  being arived in this place, he being an ould man, desired the generall
  he might lye ashore in any howse he would apoint hym; but, in lieu
  of his demand, he clapt iron shackles on his legges, not geveing hym
  a peny to buy hym foode nor rayment, which drove the ould man into
  such desperation that he ment to hang hym selfe. In fine, he did curse
  the Hollanders extremely, and said they had misused our English nation
  very much in the Molucas, which he hoped would com to the King of Englands
  knowledg, that he might take revenge on them. He had his boltes or
  shackles on his legges when he spake to me, and still, when he looked
  on them, wept lyke a childe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 18.</i>&mdash;Soyemon Dono sent for one of our <i>jurebassos</i>,
  and bid hym tell me that Tonomon Samme, the kinges brother, Taccamon
  Dono, cheefe justis, and hym selfe ment to goe a fyshing within a day
  or two, and desired my company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 19.</i>&mdash;Tonomon Samme, kinges brother, sent for me to make
  an end of my processe with the scrivano of junk. And I fownd Bongo
  Samme, Taccamon Dono, and Soyemon Dono, Shosque Dono, and others in
  company with hym, but the scrivano was not there (at least he was not
  in sight). I tould them I needed not to speake any more about this
  matter, for that Taccamon Dono knew it as well as my selfe. In fine,
  they referd me till to morrow to take <i>danco</i> (or councell).</p>
<p>And I thought good to note downe how, in the meane tyme I was theare,
  Capt. Speck sent his <i>jurebasso</i> to demand lycence to sell 2000
  deare skins, which I make accompt came in their shipps which tuched
  at Pattania, or else they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> are purchase. They retornd hym answer they would take
  councell about it, althoughe he aledged the losse of them this hot
  wether, yf present sale were not made. In fine, I had nothing saide
  for selling ours (to the China Capt.) which came in Shoby Donos junk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 20.</i>&mdash;Soyemon Dono came and tould me how I was to make
  my writing against the theevish scrivano, and dowbted not but I should
  get my processe; but desird me to keepe it secret, for that he would
  not be knowne to favor my cause, he being to judg of the matter betwixt
  us.</p>
<p>There was reportes geven out of 2 junkes which are arived in a port of
  Shaxma, which came from Syam, one of them thought to be the <i>Sea
  Adventure</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 21.</i>&mdash;The kinges brother, Tonomon Samme, sent for me to
  make an end of my processe with the scrivano of Giquan, whome I fownd
  accompanid with the boateswane of the junk and the China, Giquans kynsman,
  with an other fello who cleamed 120 <i>picos</i> sappon of our wood,
  but had no papers to shew, but tould a longe Canterbury tale. But this
  Jno. a Nokes was sowne sent away. The China desird restetution of the
  junk, and that the scrivano should deliver the dead mans goodes unto
  hym. But I shewed bills that I had right both to the one and other,
  and desired the scrivano might deliver those goodes to me, as also
  42 <i>picos</i> sappon yet wanting of the cupplement. So we weare all
  dismissed and attend the conclution. I forgot to note down that the
  China brought a <i>jurebasso</i> with hym who spoke the Japon tonge,
  and I shewing them ij bills I had in the China tong, this fello spake
  to the <i>jurebasso</i> to say they were not made as they ought to
  be, and that it might passe because none of us knew the China tong;
  but the <i>jurebasso</i> reproved hym. I think the reason was because
  he was much in feare to fall into danger per any occation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 22.</i>&mdash;I rec. 2 letters from Jor. Durois, dated in Langasaque,
  le 22th and 25th July, new stile. He writes still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> that it is true that 20 gallions are at Malacca, and
  are gon for Bantam, as also that the Spaniardes have taken the ij Holland
  shipps, which yet want, at the battle of Manillia, which, if it be
  soe, are called the <i>New</i> and <i>Ould Moon</i>. He saieth also
  they took a galle; but that is a lie, for the Hollanders had non (as
  they say).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 23.</i>&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to the kinges brother
  to know what end he will make of my processe against the scrivano.
  He retorned answer how he had this day envited the Hollanders to dyner,
  but tomorrow would geve me to understand of all. And sowne after he
  sent to borrow our chears, cushins, spoons, silver forkes, cups, tableclothes,
  and napkins, with one of our Japon servantes, to show them how to order
  the meate after the Christen fation, and withall sent for a bottell
  Spanish wyne and som salet oyle; all which was sent hym.</p>
<p>And I thought good to note downe how Mr. Nealson and Mr. Totton went abord
  the Holland shipp which is sunk, being envited per the master and pilot;
  but the Japon <i>bongew</i> took one of our rowers out of the boate,
  beating hym and sending hym per land to Taccamon Dono, who sowne after
  set hym at liberty and sent hym to me.</p>
<p>There came newes to towne of a boates casting away coming from Langasaque,
  wherin were iij Chinas and 6 Japons. God grant there were no money
  in it sent from Capt. Whaw, the China Capt., for me. We wrot hym to
  send som.</p>
<p>Our <i>jurebasso</i> brought back the plate and lynen lent the kyng, and
  tould us of the greate feaste was made to the Hollanders, and the lustie
  drinking, and that, amongst other talkes, Capt. Speck asked what our <i>jurebasso</i> made
  theare, and was answered for his skill in cookery. At their departure
  (I meane the Hollanders) from the kinges howse, there was 15 peeces
  ordinance shot affe.</p>
<p>We delivered divers sortes merchandiz to Jno. Japon to sell in the shopp
  or shew roome over the way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 24.</i>&mdash;The Duch preacher of thadmerall ship came to vizet
  me. He was borne at Hornchurch, in Essex, and his mother an English
  woman. I gave hym a new peare black silk stockinges. Yt seemeth he
  is awery of being amongst these Hollanders, whom he sayeth have littell
  respect to religion, and therefore doth not marvill that God hath chastissed
  them in their proceadinges at Manillias.</p>
<p>I receved 5 letters from Edo, viz. 1 from Mrs. Adames, 1 from her sonne
  Joseph, 1 from her sister Magdalena, 1 from Andrea, Mag. husband, 1
  from Tome, the <i>jurebasso</i> of Massamoneda. Mrs. Adames writes
  that Neamon Dono is coming downe to bring money for all our goodes
  sould.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 25.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Gonrok Dono about my processe
  with scrivano, and sent Mr. Totton with it, accompanid with Harry Shank
  and Co. John for <i>jurebasso</i>.</p>
<p>Also I wrot another letter to Jorge Durois in answer of his two, and sent
  hym 30 <i>tais</i> per Mr. Totton, paid out per Mr. Jno. Osterwick,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
I rec. a letter from Capt. Whow, China Capt. at Langasaque, with 10 pots
  sett with trees and slowers [flowers?], and 4 gilden fyshes, for a
  present.</p>
<p>I forgot to note downe how Soyemon Dono made a fishing over against English
  howse with cormorants made fast to long cordes behind their winges,
  and bridles from thence before their neckes to keepe the fish from
  entring their bodies, so that when they took it they could take yt
  out of their throtes againe.</p>
<p>This day one George Dowry,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> an
  English gentleman which serveth in the Holland shipp (whose father,
  as I understand, is a Devonshire man and a justice of peace and dwelleth
  at Dowry house), he tould me that there is much hould and keepe amongst
  the Holland councell heare. Som would have the comander to goe up,
  and others no, espetialy Capt. Speck is wholy against it. Soe it is
  thought the fiscall shall procead in that voyage. Also he sayeth the
  comander, Jno. Dirickson Lamb, is much blamed for his proceadinges
  at Manillas, his comition being to keepe his fleete togeather to defeate
  that of Don Juan de Silva; but he unadvisedly seperated them, and so
  was set upon at an unadvantadg, by which meanes he was overthrowne.</p>
<p>He also tould me they took a small junck, wherin they fownd all Don Jno.
  de Silvas designes, emprinted in the Spanish tong in the Manillias,
  which was to have joyned his forces of the Manillias, which were 10
  gallions, to those which he thought to have fownd at Malacca com from
  Goa and other places, which, with gallies and other vessells of war,
  might be as many more, I meane 20 seale in all. With which forces he
  first thought to have gon directly for the Ilands of Murises<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>,
  there to have met with such Holland shipps as were bound homwards,
  and after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> spoile of them to have retorned by the cost of Sumatra,
  and so for Bantam, to have destroid all, both English and Duch, not
  letting any one remeane alive, generall nor other. But, as I noted
  heretofore, his forces he ment to have met at Malacca were destroid
  and 4 gallions Portugezes burned, one per the King of Achin and the
  other 3 per the Hollanders. So, Don Jno. dying at Malacca, his fleet
  was dispersed, one gallion being cast away in a storme at Malacca,
  and other 2 sent for New Spayne. So 7 retorned for Manillas, where
  they wintered and were brought agrownd, most of them being halfe full
  of water and all unrigged when the Hollanders first came on the cost,
  which they saw with their eyes; yet the gridines of pilling China junks
  made them to abstayne from that they ought to have donne till it was
  to late to be amended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 26.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Capt. Whow, to thank hym for
  the present he sent me; and I gave his men which brought it in a boate,
  they being xij men, a bagg of rise, a barill of wyne, and one <i>tay</i> in
  small plate. Capt Whow sent an other present to Capt. Speck with an
  other letter; but he did not vouchsafe to thank hym for it, nor to
  write a letter in answer of his, nor gave any thing to them which brought
  the present.</p>
<p>Capt. Shoby Dono came to Firando and brought me a present of halfe a lb.
  of lignum allowas (or <i>calemback</i><a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>),
  with 2 Champa matts. And an other which came in company with hym brought
  me a box of cumfets.</p>
<p>Leonard the Hollander came to thenglish howse and tould me the <i>tonos</i> brother
  (Tonomon Samme) asketh a therd of all they have taken, in right of
  his brother; but I think they will not [geve] it. I had rather have
  that then ten kyngdoms of Firando.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 27.</i>&mdash;The Hollanders envited Lues Martin and Alvaro Munes
  abord the <i>Black Lion</i> whoe is admerall, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> their weare many guns shot affe for healths, but of
  whome I know not, for I cannot esteem it was for the King of Spaine,
  whoe is their mortall enemye; and at their retorne ashore had 3 calverins
  shot afe for a farewell. Many Japons and Chinas took notis thereof
  and could not chuse but laugh.</p>
<p>We made an accompt at hazard or by estimation with Tozayemon Dono, host
  of Sackay, as apeareth by perticulars noted downe in the wast book,
  viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 28.</i>&mdash;This day was held festivall by the nobles of Firando
  in remembrance of Dono Samme, father of Foyne Samme, soe that (as their
  order is) they drunk hard, pristes and all. And in the end Tonomon
  Samme, the kinges brother, going home, met a Hollander in the streete,
  it may be in as good a pickell as hym selfe, and, because he used no
  reverence to hym, caused his men to beate hym, breaking his head and
  cuting affe 2 or 3 of his fingers. But he was nothing comended of any
  man for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 29.</i>&mdash;Mr. Totton retorned from Langasaque, and brought
  word that Gonrok Dono said our bills in China languadg and Japons were
  made soe short that he could not judg on our side, but rather on the
  contrary. Soe it seemeth he harkned on both the China and the Japon
  scrivano, Cayanseque, to proceead against me, the one for 140 <i>pico</i> wood,
  and the other for all the dead China capt. Giquans goods. So now they
  are retorned all to Firando.</p>
<p>It is said Belange Lewes junk is com from the Manillas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> within 9 or 10 leages of Langasaque, but
  not yet entred, and 2 or 3 other junks upon the cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 30.</i>&mdash;We were envited to supper to Taccamon Dono as the
  China Capt. was the like, where we had good cheare, <i>nifon catange</i> (or
  Japon fation), and at departure he gave me a <i>wacadash</i> (or small
  Japon <i>cattan</i>) and a <i>catabra</i> to China Capt.</p>
<p>I receaved a letter from Mr. George Savidge, per a China, dated in Camboja,
  le 10th May last past, wherin he writes me how the Portingales did
  soe insence the king against our nation at his first arivall that once
  he gave order that he should avoid out of his dominions, but after,
  upon better enformetion of their false reportes, caused hym to stay.
  And since that tyme, fynding the Portingales gilty of treason against
  the king and his sonne, he hath banished them all out of his dominions,
  and the rather for that they took a Holland bark going out and carid
  men and goods to Amacau.</p>
<p>Tonomon Samme sent ij men unto me to know whether I would deliver 140 <i>pico</i> wood
  to the scrivano and 30 to the China <i>tico</i>. I sent Mr. Osterwick
  back with them, with a <i>jurebasso</i>, to tell hym I had no wood
  for the one nor other, but to the contrary was to rec. 42 <i>pico</i> I
  yet wanted, and desird that handes might be laid on the said scrivano
  that he made not an escape till he had delivered the said sappon and
  Chinas goodes, etc.</p>
<p>Jno. Osterwick, going abroad with the Hollanders and being drunken, misused
  me in termes at his pleasure. I find hym a prowd, surly yong man, and
  one that scorns all men in respect of hym selfe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 31.</i>&mdash;Much rayne per night with extreme lightnyng and
  thunder, as I have not heard the lyke since we arived in Japon.</p>
<p>I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to thank Taccamon Dono for our good cheare,
  and to goe to Tonomon Samme to desire hym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> to keepe fast Cayanseque, the scrivano, till he delivered
  me the 42 <i>pico</i> sappon and the Chinas goodes which is dead. But
  he could not com to speech of Tonomon Samme, but left word with his
  man.</p>
<p>We had news that the capt. moore of the Portingall shipp at Langasaque
  comanded Lues Martin to accompany hym to Miaco (or Edo), to speake
  to themperour and mak complaint against the Hollanders for robing at
  seas. But Lues Martin denid hym and came secretly to Firando, for which
  the Porting. capt. thretneth to hang hym.</p>
<p>I rec. a letter from Alvaro Munos, from Langasaque, dated le 8th August,
  new stile, wherin he wrot me how Billang Luis is arived from the Manillas,
  reporting the overthrow the Spaniardes had geven to the Hollanders
  in that place, burnyng and sinking 3 of their ships and driveing other
  2 on grownd, with the losse of 66 Spaniardes, and had taken 80 Hollanders
  prisoners, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 1.</i>&mdash;I rec. 3 letters this day, in Japons, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>1 from Edo, from the King of Crates; 1 from Miaco, from Safian Dono; 1
  from Miaco, from Jubio Dono&mdash;all three letters complementall in
  answer of myne.</p>
<p>And in the after nowne I rec. a letter from Mr. Wickham, how he was arived
  within 3 or 4 leagues of Firando; and therupon I sent out the <i>foyfone</i> with
  Mr. Totton to meet them, whoe brought them into the roade of Cochy
  late at night. And Mr. Wickham came ashore within night, and tould
  me how the Hollanders had taken the &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and <i>Swan</i>,
  tow of the Hon<sup>ble</sup> Companies ships that were in the Molucas,
  kyling 5 men in doing therof, and keepe the rest prisoners, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 2.</i>&mdash;The <i>Adviz</i> entred into harbour of Firando,
  and Taccamon Dono came abord her before shee entred, sending 12 or
  14 boates to tow her in, as the Hollanders sent their <i>foyfone</i> with
  20 ores to helpe to doe the lyke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> Taccamon Dono had 5 peeces ordinance shot affe at his
  departure, and other 5 we shot affe as we passed by the Duch howse,
  they haveing first shot 5 pece out of admerall, and after, other 5
  from howse; and when we came to an ancor we shot affe 7 more, and the
  Holland admerall answerd with 5. So, going ashore, we had 7 more shot
  affe.</p>
<p>The <i>tono</i> sent ij men to stay abord (as he said) till our goods
  were delivered ashore, to see we had no injury offered us. I answerd
  them it was needles, yet in thend was content they should stay this
  night, till I had better enformed the king of the matter.</p>
<p>The Japons stole Mr. Tottons Terky coate (or gowne) from abord [it haveng
  a gould ring with a diamond in the pocket],<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> no
  ring in it.</p>
<p>And I rec. of Mr. Wickham these letters following, viz.:</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 generall letter from Wor. Compa., dated in London, 30th July 1615, with
  1 copy sent per <i>Clove</i> to us in generall, and 1 copy per <i>Clove</i> to
  Capt. Adames.</p>

<p>Tonomon Samme, the kinges brother, sent me 3 <i>barsos</i> wyne, 3 drid
  salmon, and a lynen <i>catabra</i> for a present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 3.</i>&mdash;I sent a note to Tonomon Samme of such sortes of
  merchandiz as we had in our shipp, and withall desird that no <i>bongew</i> might
  be sufferd to remeane abord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> it being a scandall to our nation as also against our
  prevelegese, which never had any such matter offred till now.</p>
<p>After nowne Tonomon Samme, the kinges brother, accompanid with Unagense
  Dono and Soyemon Dono, came to thenglish howse, and at same tyme Capt.
  Speck came also per water. So I made them colation. And Tonomon Samme
  departed, biding me unlade our goodes when we would. Capt. Speck came
  to heare news and brought me 3 bottells Spa. wyne.</p>
<p>Tonomon Same sent to have a parrat which was in our shipp, which was thought
  good to buy of the carpenter and geve hym. Also I sent a munky to Taccamon
  Dono. Both which presentes were taken in good parte. And Mr. Wedmer,
  master mate, gave me a parakita, and the chirurgion gave me the munky
  I gave Taccamon Dono.</p>
<p>This day was a Japon rosted to death, runing rownd about a post, fyre
  being made about hym. The occation was for staling a small bark of
  littell or no vallue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 4.</i>&mdash;The Japons and Chinas unladed their goodes, because
  they did lie on the top of ours. And we rec. ashore 2 chists silk,
  no. 14 and no. 20, but the rope broke in taking up no. &mdash;&mdash;;
  soe it fell into the water and was much endomaged by watering; but
  we washed it forthwith in fresh water.</p>
<p>Flying newes came that Capt. Adams junck is arived in Xaxma, but of no
  certenty.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to Gonrok Dono about my processe: seeing it could not
  be ended nether heare nor at Langasaque, I ment to remove it to Miaco.
  Also I advised hym of the arivall of our ship <i>Adviz</i> and what
  sortes goodes she brought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 5.</i>&mdash;After daylight was don the last night, word came
  that the Hollandes junk was arived neare unto Langasaque, haveng byn
  almost 2 monthes on the way, so that dyvers are dead for want of water
  and all the rest full of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> skervie. God send us good news of ours, for she was
  ready to com away with the other.</p>
<p>We rec. ashore this day out of th&rsquo; <i>Adviz</i> 16 chist of silk.</p>
<p>An Englishman came to thenglish howse, and secretly willed me to take
  heed how I accompanid the Duch or did eate or drink with them, for
  that they hated our nation mortally, and in all their councells (which
  daily they held) they ordayned and coyned articles against as how we
  abused them, and fermed it with all their handes, to send for England
  to their embassador, to stur up the Kinges Majesty of England against
  us his naturall subjectes. And, amongst the rest, he tould me of a
  Hollandes trick (worse then a Flemish) which they used, and was, when
  they had forcably taken the pocession of Poolaway from our English,
  it being rendred up to the Kinges Majesty of England, they called a
  generall counsell upon it, and forsably made an English merchant, whom
  they thretned with death, to sett his hand to a writing how he sould
  2 peeces of ordinance to the blacks (or Mores) which brought them downe
  bownd from the fortresse, although they were sent on per the Hollanders
  to doe it. Which 2 peeces they ment to send for England with a glavering
  falce letter to exskewse themselves, laying the falt on the Mores,
  and that by the Hollanders meanes our mens lyves were saved.</p>
<p>This night began the feast of <i>bonbon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> or
  for the dead, with hanging out of candell light, and enviting the dead,
  etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 6.</i>&mdash;This mornyng the Duch junk from Syam entred into
  the harbour of Firando. They say our junk was ready to departe within
  2 or 3 daies after them.</p>
<p>The Hollandes ship being to be brought in this feast day, they could get
  no men; soe Capt. Speck sent to desire me to lend hym our bark (or <i>foy
  foney</i>), which I did, with 16 ores to toe them in, they haveinge
  sent theirs before with 20<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> ores to helpe our shipp in. So the <i>Red Lyon</i> that
  was cast away was made tite and brought in this day.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter to Gonrok Dono, in answer of his, that I apealed to
  the Emperor, and would not stand to his sentence.</p>
<p>We rec. out of the <i>Adviz</i> this day, viz.: silke, 18 chistes; bayes,
  1 bale; brod clo., 10 fard.; cony skins, 2 bales, these most parte
  rotton and spoild; wax, 6 <i>catty</i>.</p>
<p>There was a greate eclips of the moone this night past, about 3 a clock
  after midnight, which Mr. Nealson and Mr. Totton observed, to find
  the true longetude of this towne of Firando, which standeth in 32&frac12; degrees
  of latetude to the northward of the equenoctiall; and the stars they
  observed weare the Bulls eye and Hercus, the goate, I being present
  when she was halfe darkened, and the Bulls eye was 46 degrees above
  the horison, and Hercus 46 degrees and 40 minutes; and when she was
  wholy discovered the Bull eye 52 &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>min.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 7.</i>&mdash;Before dyner Ed. Sayer arived at Firando and brought
  me in a letter from Capt. Adames, dated in Goto, 3th current, advising
  he hath fownd but a loosing voyage, 800 <i>taies</i> at least. Also
  that the King of Cochinchina is well contented our nation shall trade
  into his cuntrey; but the cheefe men about hym, as it should seeme,
  weare axesary to the death of Mr. Peacock, and had parted the Companies
  goodes amongst them, with his host the Japon, whoe fled away whilest
  they were in Cochinchina, fearing to be brought in question.</p>
<p>So I retorned answer to Capt. Adames per the bark brought Ed. Sayer, unto
  whome was paid 4 <i>taies</i> small plate, and a bag rise; and a peece
  damaske sent the <i>bongew</i> Musioyen Dono, cost 4 R. 8, with a letter
  complementall.</p>
<p>And there was rec. out of the <i>Adviz</i>, viz.: brod clo., 2 bales;
  perpetuano,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> 1

  hampers silk; 1 bale kersies; 1 bale lambskins, all spoild and rotton,
  not one skin left sownd, and 280 stark spoild; with 2 other bales cony
  skins, all in very bad taking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 8.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. went to Goto this day to Niguan
  his kinsman, whoe is come in his junk from Cochinchina. Unto whome
  I sent a barill <i>morofack</i> and a littell pott green ginger.</p>
<p>And we rec. ashore this day out of <i>Adviz</i> nyne hundred and seventy
  bars of leade.</p>
<p>The ij <i>bongews</i> of our shipp <i>Adviz</i> came to the English howse
  and fell a swaggaring, and gave us bad wordes about the stealing of
  Mr. Tottons coate, and, doe what I could, I could not get them out
  of the howse. So I was forced to send Mr. Osterwick with a <i>jurebasso</i> to
  Tonomon Samme, or Taccamon Dono, to comand them out of our howse, because
  we could not be in quiet for them. But the noble men were gon a hunting,
  and the brablars departed when they thought good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 9.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. retorned back, the wind being contrary,
  and went not to Goto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 10.</i>&mdash;The kinges brother sent back the parrot I gave
  hym, to keepe her, she being sick, or I rather think to have a better
  present sent in place, for the parrot is well. He also sent word he
  would use the <i>bonyews</i> no more abord.</p>
<p>I rec. a letter from Gonrok Dono, tuching my proces with Casanseque, that
  he wisheth it might be ended heare in Firando, and not sent above.
  Also he adviseth me to send word to Safian Dono of goodes com in our
  ship, and not sell any till we know what themperour will take. God
  send merchantes, and then I meane to sell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 11.</i>&mdash;Naquan the China arived from Cochinchina this
  moryning, and left junk at Goto; and meane to unlade ther silk theare
  and carry it to Langasaque, because men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> are misused heare. And soe the Japons meane to doe
  the lyke with that com in Capt. Adams junk.</p>
<p>The China Capt. came in hast and tould me that he had news the Emperour
  was much offended with the Hollanders, because they had taken the China
  junks, stryking his hand on his thigh 3 times when he first heard it,
  saying he would not suffer them to doe it.</p>
<p>We rec. six hundred and seventy bars lead out of the <i>Adviz</i>; and
  Gonrok sent word to have all our lead for themperour, of which I desired
  a bill of [hym].</p>
<p>Word was brought towardes night that Capt. Adames junk was on the backsyde
  of the iland of Firando, and sent for boates to toe hym in. Soe I sent
  out our <i>foy fone</i>; as also the <i>tono</i> sent out divers other
  barkes. But it was past midnight before she came in, the tide being
  against them. He came to vizet me, I not being well, and tould me the
  King of Cochinchina knew nothing of the murdering of Mr. Peacock, but
  that he was cast away per casualty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 12.</i>&mdash;We rec. 215 bars, I say two hundred and fyfteene
  bars lead ashore out of th&rsquo; <i>Adviz</i>, which is the whole complement
  of lead, being 2065 bars in all. So now all goodes are rec. out of
  th&rsquo; <i>Adviz</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 13.</i>&mdash;Gonrok Donos man with ij of Tonomon Sammes men
  came and looked on our lead, and took one bar for sample to shew Gonrok
  Dono, containing 43 <i>ll</i> Eng. was 33 <i>cattis</i> Japon, the
  price at 6 <i>tais picull</i>; all staid for themperour. As alsoe they
  tak all the Hollanders have, Syam lead and other; but that is not soe
  good.</p>
<p>There was rec. ashore out of Capt. Adams junk, viz. 2 chistes merchandizs,
  1 bale galles, retorned unsould from Cochinchina; 2 chistes aguila,
  2 hampers silk, bought at Cochinchina.</p>
<p>The chirurgion of the <i>Adviz</i> now com, called Benjamyn Parsons, being
  (as I take it) drunken, met the Duch fiscall in the streete, and, like
  a bestly knave as he was, gerded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> out ... telling hym it was for the Hollanders. Wherupon
  he cam to thenglish howse and complained; but at that tyme I was ill
  at ease, and did not speake with hym; otherwaies he had been punished
  according to his desertes. But after, the said fiscall beged his pardon.
  This chirurgion is a drunken quarelsom fello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 14.</i>&mdash;The servant of Gonrok dono with 2 of the kinges
  servantes came to thenglish howse to have set my hand to a China letter,
  how I had 500 <i>pico</i> lead, at 6 <i>tais</i> per <i>pico</i>, for
  themperor, and not under. And in the meane tyme, as we were debating
  the matter (I denying to set my ferme to any such writinges I knew
  not), came the China Capt., and tould me they had set downe 5000 <i>piculls</i> for
  500. In fine, I denid seting hand to any writing, although they aledged
  that Capt. Speck had, for 600 <i>pico</i>, Syam lead, now com in their
  junck.</p>
<p>Also the kinges brother sent to have me send to Langasaque about my plito
  with Casanseque, the scrivano; which I denyed, desiring justice here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 15.</i>&mdash;I carid a present to Tonomon Samme, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
   <li>2 <i>tatta.</i> sad blew cloth,</li>
      <li>&frac12; a kersy, pepper green,</li>
      <li>&frac12; a pec. naro perpetuano,</li>
      <li>1 pece fustian,</li>
      <li>1 <i>catty</i> calemback,</li>

</ul>
<p>which he seemed to take in good parte; and I desird of hym to have a bark
  to cary up the Emperours present, which he answerd me he would look
  out for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 16.</i>&mdash;I gave Niquan, the China, 1&frac14; <i>tatta</i> black
  cloth, fyne cloth, in respeck he (as I think) taketh paines about our
  entrance into China.</p>
<p>And ther was a present geven Taccamon Dono, cheefe justice:&mdash;</p>
<ul>

    <li>1&frac14; <i>tatta.</i> sad blew.</li>
      <li>2 <i>tatt.</i> carsyes, pepper green.</li>
      <li>&frac14; peec. naro perpetuano.</li>

      <li>1 <i>catty</i> calemback.</li>

</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
We began to way out the lead for themperour, but they brought 2 falce
  beames, one over 6 per cento, and thother 4 per cento. So we gave over;
  and they carid 4 bars to Langasaque, waying 115 <i>cattis</i> per our
  beame, to try it per kinges beame theare.</p>
<p>The China Capt. gave me a peece yello shagy velvett.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 17.</i>&mdash;I rec. a letter from the King of Firando, from
  Miaco, wherin he advized me to mak hast up, for that themperour would
  retorne back within a month.</p>
<p>One of the <i>Advizes</i> company died this day, called Yewen Lake, whome
  was coffend and carid to the Christian buriall place, with a hearse
  (or coveryng) of black bayes carid over hym.</p>
<p>Oyen Dono came and viseted me to day, telling me it was best to reserve
  the greatest parte of the present for the King of Firando till his
  coming to Firando.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 18.</i>&mdash;We laid out and packed up our cargezon goodes
  to cary to Miaco for presentes and otherwais, with an over plus to
  sel or bring back.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham, according to his accustomed use, set me at nought, geveing
  me bad words, as Capt. Adams and others can witnes, saying his tyme
  was out, and that he would goe for England, and serve the Company no
  longer.</p>
<p>We had much a doe with the brabling Japons which came out of England,
  they demanding more then their due, as 10 <i>taies</i> for 3 mo., when
  per my book most of them had but 7&frac12; <i>tais</i> per 3 mo., and
  the most (which was but one) had but 29 <i>mas</i> per month, and demanded
  350 <i>tais</i> for their losses in England; and, had not Mr. Wickham
  brought a writing from Bantam of 150 Rs. of 8 rec. per them there,
  in consideration of the said losses, with all their ferms at it, they
  would have put us to much trouble. And one of them took Capt. Adames
  by the throte in his owne lodging, because he would not stand out for
  them that all the money they receved impres, at Capt. Saris being heare,
  was geven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> them gratis; and thought to have laid violent handes
  one Mancho, the <i>jurebasso</i>, because he witnessed the truth. I
  had much a doe to hold my handes that I had not cut affe one or two
  of their heades, which I make no dowbt but I might well have answerd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 19.</i>&mdash;Here came flying speeches of 3 junkes arived at
  Goto, one of which is thought to be ours.</p>
<p>And it was thought fyt to geve two presents unto the China Capt., Andrea
  Dittis, at Firando, and his brother, Capt. Whowe, at Langasaque, viz.:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>&frac14; of black broad perpetuano.</li>
      <li>&frac14; of haircullr naro perpetuano.</li>
      <li>&frac12; a peec. fustion.</li>
   </ul>

<p>I say to each of them thus much, in hope of their travill to procure trade
  into China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 20.</i>&mdash;The Hollanders went up this day towardes themperour.
  So their shipps shot affe ordinance at their departure, viz. Albartus,
  Matias, and Mr. Barkhoult were sent on this busynes.</p>
<p>And we are ready to departe, but can get no bark, but words of the kinges
  offecers; soe we are determined to hire a bark of Sackay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 21.</i>&mdash;This evenyng arived a junk from Cochinchina, being
  put on the cost of Corea, and bringeth word a junk is without, her
  mast cut overbord, which we esteem to be ours, and therefore send out
  our <i>foyfon</i> with victuelles and fresh water, they being in destress.
  Also the China Capt. junk arived from Tonkyn at [night].</p>
<p>The Hollanders departed toward the Cort this morning, and shot affe much
  ordenance from abord shipps and at howse.</p>
<p>We, being driven off from tyme to tyme per the <i>tono</i>, hired a bark
  of Sackay to carry up the present, for 80 <i>tais</i> plate bars, besides
  a bar plate for master and another to company.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
<p>A junk from Cochinchina entred late this night, her lading for Chinas
  of Cochinchina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 22.</i>&mdash;There came in a small junk of China very late
  this night, laden with pursalon, or China vessells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 23.</i>&mdash;I gave Robert Haley, the chirurgion, ten <i>taies</i> for
  som other matters he formerly had geven me.</p>
<p>I delivered two hundred <i>tais</i> to Mr. Osterwick to lay out in my
  abcense to Miaco. And I delivered up 3 memorialls, viz. 1 to Mr. Wm.
  Nealson; 1 to Mr. Jno. Osterwick; 1 to Ed. Sayer, for hym selfe and
  Mr. Wm. Eaton&mdash;all of what I would have donne in my abcense at
  Miaco, as appeareth by coppie.</p>
<p>So we laded all our goods abord the bark for Miaco. And coming to knowledge
  that the mutenose Japons which are com out of England had put up a
  petission against me to the justice, that I would not pay them their
  wagis, I made answer to yt of their villanos cariadge and falce slandering
  of me, I being ready to pay them their due owing to them, as Capt.
  Adames and Mansho the <i>jurebasso</i> are witnesses at bargen making,
  and as I set it downe in my book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 24.</i>&mdash;The kinges brothers, Tonomon Samme, sent me word
  to pay the brabling marreners Japons which came out of England, according
  as I had agreed with them, and for the rest of our processe, to make
  it knowne to the king his brother at Miaco, who noe dowbt would take
  order to geve me content. He also sent me word he would send a <i>bongew</i> with
  me to assist me in my busenes on the way; but I retorned hym answer
  it was needles, the king his brother being above.</p>
<p>The China Capt. retornd from Goto, and is of the opinion that our junk,
  the <i>Sea Adventure</i>, is put into Tushma, and that it is she which
  lost her maine mast. God send us good news of her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 25.</i>&mdash;I paid Mr. Nealson ten <i>pozos</i> and twenty <i>taies</i> in
  plate bars for the matters following, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a difference betwixt the China Capt., Andrea Dittis, and Mr.
  Nealson, he denying fyftie <i>taies</i> that the China Capt. fownd
  per acco. he had delivered unto hym, the one and other standing stiffly
  in their opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Osterwick paid fowre hundred and two <i>taies</i> plate bars to the
  Japon mareners which came out of England.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 26.</i>&mdash;The wether being soe fowle both yisterday and
  this mornyng staid us from seting forwardes towardes themperours court,
  all things being ready laden abord.</p>
<p>About 10 a clock we departed from Firando to goe to Miaco; and the <i>Adviz</i> shot
  affe 7 pec. ordinance, as also the Hollandes ship shot affe 5 with
  8 from the Hollandes howse. Soe we got to Languay<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> this
  night, wheare we staid at an ancor till som 2 howers before day, it
  being calme, and then, the tide coming, waying ancor we rowed away.
  Capt. Adames went with us in a bark of his owne, as also 3 or 4 other
  barks the lyke, on being our hostis of Bingana Tomo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 27.</i>&mdash;This mornyng calme wether, and after, wynd variable
  per fittes, sometyme calme, with lightning and thunder towardes the
  northward, with much rayne, the wind vering, a storme to N.E.; soe
  that we constrayned to enter into a port of Faccata, called Imatds,
  16 leagues from Lanquay. At which place we had newes that our junk,
  the <i>Sea Adventure</i> was entred into Tushma 3 daies past, many
  of her men being dead. Also the junk which we heard had lost her meanemast
  entred into a harbor of Faccata 5 daies past. She came from Tonkyn.
  Of which I advised in a letter to Firando directed to Mr. Nealson and
  Mr. Osterwick, as also of our arivall heare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 28.</i>&mdash;We went ashore at Imatds, I being very ill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> at ease, as Capt. Adames did the like the
  night before. I think we had eaten or drunken somthing
  that was not good, so I drank a littell rose a Solas,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> which
  presently made me to vomet, which did me much ease; and
  late at night I drunke a littell bezas ston, which gave
  me much paine most parte of night, as thought 100 wormes
  had byn knawing at my hart; yet it gave me ease afterward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 29.</i>&mdash;Som 3 howers before day we departed from Imatds
  onwardes on our voyage and paid the howse, viz. to the host for use
  of his howse 1 bar plate, containing 3 : 1 : 0, and to his wife for
  to buy oyle, 0 : 5 : 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 30.</i>&mdash;With much a doe this day we got to Shiminaseake
  within night, yt proving stormy wether, with rayne, wind S.erly per
  night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>August 31.</i>&mdash;At this place we understood the Corean embassadors
  departed from hence yesterday in the mornyng with 450 men in their
  company, Coreans, 3 of them being princepall, and all goe in like authoretie.
  The Emperour hath geven charg to use them respectively in all pleases
  wheare they passe, as hath byn both at Tushma, Ishew, of Firando, Faccata,
  and this place of Shimenaseak, new howses being built for receapt of
  them in eache place, with boates to convay them per sea and horse and <i>neremons</i> (or
  litters) per land, all at themperour of Japons cost. Som report (and
  are the commons) that they are com to render obaysance and pay tribute,
  otherwaies themperour would have made wars against them againe. But
  others are of a contrary opinion, that they com to entreate the [Emperour]
  that them of Tushma may trade noe more into Corea, but rather that
  the Coreans may com to Tushma or other partes of Japon.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick to same effect as my
  former from Imadts, as also that Coreans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span> passed from Shimina Seak yisterday, and left this letter
  with our host at Ximinaseak to send for Firando.</p>
<p>So we paid our host at Ximina, for diet and howsrom the night past and
  till nowne to day, 4 <i>taies</i>. And so departed from Ximina Seak,
  haveing a stiff gale wynd, W.erly, somtyme S.erly, and somtymes northerly,
  all rest day and night following. Soe that the next day in the mornyng
  we weare at a place called Yew,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> 45
  leagues from Ximina Seak, haveing out gon the Coreans this night past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 1.</i>&mdash;I met Neyamon Dono as he passed towardes Firando.
  Soe, per meanes of contrary windes, we stoped tides, and got this day
  and night following to son rising 20 leagues, 10 leagues short of Bingana
  Tomo.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 2.</i>&mdash;I wrot an other letter to Firando to Mr. Nealson
  and Mr. Eaton, and delivered it to our hostis of Bingana Tomo to send
  unto them, she metting with us at sea near Bingano Tomo, yet went from
  Firando 3 daies before us.</p>
<p>We went into Bingana Tomo to stay tide, where our host sent me a <i>barso</i> wyne
  and a baskit peaches.</p>
<p>So we passed Bingana Tomo vij leagues, and came to ancor at a wast iland,
  haveing made this day and night following xvij leagues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 3.</i>&mdash;This day and night following we made but xiij
  leagues, geting to an ancor at a place called Wishmado, 10 leagues
  to short of Moro.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 4.</i>&mdash;Wee gott this day and night following to the
  bar of Osaky by son rising, having made per day and night 40 leagues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 5.</i>&mdash;At our arivall at Osaky our host Cuimon Dono
  was at Miaco, and the king Firando sent a man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> accompany us to hym, with 2 horses for me and Mr. Wickham.</p>
<p>This fello tould me that the Hollanders, per councell of Jno. Yossen,
  went directly to Fushamy to themperour, without making the King of
  Firando accoynted with the matter; but were by Codgkin Dono and Oyen
  Dono put back to bring a <i>bongew</i> of the King of Firandos, before
  they could be admitted audience. But (as he sayeth) the Emperour hath
  taken the present was brought per them.</p>
<p>I wrot 2 letters to Magozemon Dono and Cuemon Dono, and sent them per
  Co Jno., <i>juerabasso</i>, whom I gave order to goe to the King of
  Firando and tell hym of our arivall, and that I expected Capt. Adames
  coming this night or to morrow, and then ment to com to vizet his Highnesse,
  and tak his councell for delivery of the King of Englandes letter and
  present to themperour.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham paid the barkmen for rest of the fraight xxx <i>tais</i>,
  as also 1 bar to the master containing 3 : 2 : 5, and an other bar
  to the marreners containing 3 : 9 : 3. And I gave 6 <i>mas</i> to a
  marener which had his coate blowne over board. This money our host
  sonne laid out for me. I gave 2 musk cods, with 2 piktures of our Lady,
  the Infant Christ, and Christ crowned with thorne, paynted upon copper
  in China very lively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 6.</i>&mdash;Co Jno. retorned this night late with a letter
  from the King of Firando, whoe took it in good parte that I sent hym
  unto hym to adviz hym of our arivall, a thing which the Hollanders
  had neclected at their arivall, which gave hym much discontent, soe
  that I should find he would doe his best endevour for our English nation
  to geve themperour truly to understand the difference he fownd betwixt
  the Hollanders and English, wishing me to make what hast I could before
  the Corean ambassadors arived. And after Co Jnos departure he sent
  an other <i>bongew</i> to thank me for sending to hym the day before,
  and, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> should seeme; condemnyng the Hollanders for their proceading.
  Yet I doe consider this may be donne at thinstegation of the Hollanders,
  seting the King of Firando on to sownd me what I would say against
  them.</p>
<p>Our host at Fuxamy sent his man to bid me welcom, and expecting my coming
  to his howse.</p>
<p>And Cuimon Dono, our host of Osakay, retorned from Miaco, telling me wonders
  of the bad reportes was geaven out against the Hollanders, and good
  of thenglish, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 7.</i>&mdash;I wrot an other letter to Firando to Mr. Nealson
  and Osterwick, and sent it per an other barkman of Tome Dono. And as
  I was a writing of yt, the Corean ambassadors passed throw this towne
  per water in very pompeouse sort, they being royally entertayned all
  the way per themperours comand, and had trumpetts and hobboyes sounding
  before them in 2 or 3 severall placese.</p>
<p>I advised I ment to departe for Miaco to morrow, and, yf Capt. Adames
  came not this night, would leave a letter for hym to follow after,
  and send away presentes this night for Fuxamy.</p>
<p>And within night the ould man of Orengaua brought me a letter from Capt.
  Adames, dated in Takasanga<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> yisterday,
  22 leagues short of Osaky, signefying the danger he passed the 31th
  ultimo, a leake springing in his bark, weting and spoiling all his
  goodes, she being ready to sink under them. So, not having tyme to
  writ to Firando, I sent his letter in myne dated yisterday. He writes
  how he changed bark. And this day the ould man sayeth he thinketh he
  will be heare, I meane to morrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 8.</i>&mdash;We being ready to departe towards Miaco, Capt.
  Adames arived at Osakay. And it began to rayne. Soe our voyag was put
  offe till to morrow.</p>
<p>Our host, Magazayemon Dono of Miaco, and Maky Dono came to vizet me, as
  the King of Firandos host and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> did the lyke bring presentes of figges, peares, and
  other frute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 9.</i>&mdash;We departed this mornyng from Osakay towardes
  Miaco, where we arived this night, only to speake with the King of
  Firando before we came to Fushamy, where the Emperour la. So, late
  towardes night after our arivall, the King of Firando sent me a present
  of 4 <i>barsos morofack</i>, and 20 bags or paper packets of fyne white
  beaten rise; and Semi Dono a banketing box stuff, <i>nifon catange</i> (or
  Japon fation), with many complementall wordes of offers of greate frendshipp,
  and in som sort complayning of the Hollanders proceadinges, attributing
  all to the folly of Jno. Yosson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Firando to Mr. Nealson and
  Mr. Osterwick, and sent it per Magazemon Donos man, advising of our
  arivall heare, and the report the Hollanders did look for their dispach
  yisterday, and that the Castillanos had theirs the day before.</p>
<p>We went to the <i>Tono</i> or King of Firando, and carid hym a present
  as followeth, viz. halfe a peece of Denshier kersie, halfe a peece
  of blak broad perpetuano, halfe a peece of fustion; and to Semedone,
  viz. a vest black perpetuano and
  &frac12; pec fustion.</p>
<p>I had much conferrance with hym about our busynes, namely, how we should
  procead to have our previlegese enlarged that were shortned the yeare
  past; unto which he promised his assistance, willing us, as Semi Dono
  did the lyke, to geve out the worst speeches we could of the Hollanders,
  that it might com to themperours eares.</p>
<p>And towardes night we retorned to Fushamy, I geveing our hostis of Miaco
  2 musk cods, with 3 picturs, as afforesaid.</p>
<p>At our arivall at Fushamy, I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> to adviz Safian
  Dono of our coming; as I did the like to Cacayezamon Dono, secretary
  to Oyen Dono, and Torazemon Dono of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> Firando, whome only of the 3 was in howse, and afterwards
  sent me a barrell wyne for a present, and word that he would com to
  me in the mornyng to consider about our busynes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 11.</i>&mdash;I sent our <i>jurebasso</i> againe to Cacayezamon
  Dono, to tell hym I would gladly speake with hym. And, sowne after,
  he came, being accompanid with Torazemon Dono, and, after many wordes
  of complemento, he tould me that he thought themperour would lett us
  have any thinge that in reason we would demand; and that the Hollanders
  had their dispach, and was that, notwithstanding the petitions put
  up against them, both by Spaniardes, Portingals, and Chinas, to have
  them banished out of Japon as pirattes and sea rovars, he gaine said
  it, and tould them his cuntrey was free for all strangers, and that,
  yf any private quarrell weare betwixt them, they might seeke remedy
  at their owne princes. But the Chinas replid, and said they had no
  private quarell with them. &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, said themperour, &ldquo;where
  took they your goodes from yow?&rdquo;
  And they answered, at Manillias. &ldquo;Whie then&rdquo; said he,
  &ldquo;goe to the Manillias for your redresse. But yf they come within
  my jurisdictions, I will see yow righted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Capt. Adames came to Fuxamy this mornyng, haveing byn first at Miaco,
  and spoak with the King of Firando, who used hym respectively in extraordenary
  sort: the reason he gathered was for fear we should complaine against
  hym, as the Hollanders had donne, which yf it happened, he would be
  shifted out of his government or heritage; but, considering he oweth
  our honble. employers so much money, it is better to beare for a tyme.</p>
<p>Albartus and Matias, the Hollanders, came to vizet me at my lodging at
  same tyme when Cacayemon Dono and Torazemon Dono weare with me, but
  staid not, only tould me they ment to departe towardes Firando within
  a day or two.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 12.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames went to day and spoak with Oyen
  Dono and Codgskin Dono, themperours secretaries, to know when we might
  have audience and deliver our present. They gave hym good wordes, and
  willed hym to retorne to morrow mornyng and he should have answere.</p>
<p>The Hollanders came all 3 this day to vizet me; and, as it seemed to me
  by their speeches, they goe not away with much content, as not haveing
  their privelegese enlarged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 13.</i>&mdash;Shongo Dono the admeralls sonne sent me a present
  of a barill wyne and a box of stuffe like pack thrid, made of wheate
  flower, which the Japons use in brothes at bankets.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter to Firando to Mr. Nealson and Mr. Osterwick, dated
  yisterday but kept till to day, and sent per Mr. Albartus, the Hollanders
  retornyng towardes Firando this night per water to Osakay.</p>
<p>We carid and delivered our present to themperour with the King of Englands

  not com to be our <i>jurebasso</i>; with an other from Yodayo Dono,
  Neyamon Donos partner, and on from Neyamon Donos wife, both complementall.</p>

<p>And Mr. Wickham went to Miaco to see yf he can make sales of our goods;
  for which purpose he hath carid musters with hym.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames staid all day at castell, and in the ende shewed the petition
  to the councell, who willed hym to retorne with it to morrow, for then
  it was to late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 18.</i>&mdash;We went againe to the councell, and spoake
  with Oyen Dono, who gave me good wordes, and willed Capt. Adames to
  com to the castell and he would doe what he could to procure our despach.</p>
<p>Also I went and viseted Torazemon Dono, of Firando, and carid hym a present,
  viz. 2 <i>tata.</i> 7 inches black perpetuano, &#8531; of a peec. of fustion.</p>
<p>And I wrot a letter to Mr. Wickham, to Miaco, to look out for 6 <i>piculls</i> gunpolder;
  advising allso that Capt. Adames had delivered a bar plate to Mr. Jno.
  the <i>bos</i> (or scribe) upon acc. for his writing, containing 4 <i>ta.</i> 3 <i>m.</i> 2<i>co.</i></p>
<p>And towardes night Cacayemon Dono and Torazemon Dono came to vizet me
  with many complementall words, and tould me it was no dowbt but our
  previlegese would be enlarged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<p>I sent Co. Jno., our <i>jurebasso</i>, to accompany Cacayemon Dono to
  his lodging with a present as followeth, viz. 2 <i>tat.</i> 7 inches
  black perpetuano, &#8531; of a peece of fustion.</p>
<p>And I rec. a letter from Miaco from Mr. Wickham, dated this day, advising
  that he is offerd but a symple price for our silk, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 19.</i>&mdash;Capt. Adames went againe this mornyng to the
  Court, being retorned yisternight with answer he should com againe
  this mornyng, he haveinge sat theare all yisterday from mornyng till
  night without eating anything, as he had donne the lyke the day before.</p>
<p>I wrot a letter to Mr. Wickham, in answer of his, and sent it per expres
  to Miaco from Fushamy.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames did nothing this day nether, in respect the Coreans weare
  dispached at Cort, and all the <i>tonos</i> to the westward had leave
  to retorne to their cuntries.</p>
<p>Also the ould <i>direy</i>, or pope of Japon, died this day.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 20</i> (<i>Conguach 1</i>).&mdash;Yt is said the Coreans
  sent a present to themperour, and made their case knowne wherefore
  they were sent from the King of Corea to hym; which was, first to vizet
  the sepulcre, or doe funerall rights to the deceased Emperour Ogosho
  Samma, and next to rejoyce with his Ma<sup>tie</sup>. that now is in
  that he had soe quietly succeaded his father without wars or bloudshed,
  and lastly to desire his Ma<sup>tie</sup> to have the Coreans under
  his protection as his father had before hym, and to defend them against
  forraine envations, yf any other nation did seeke to disturbe their
  quiet, etc.</p>
<p>I wrot an other letter to Mr. Wickham per expres, to look out at the <i>tono</i> of
  Tushmas lodging yf the Coreans were ready to departe, to the entent
  to vizet them before they goe and to carry them a present.</p>
<p>And Capt. Adames retornyng againe to the Cort, I wrot a letter to Oyen
  Dono, themperours secretary, to desire his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> Lordships favour for our quick dispach and enlardging
  of our previlegese. But nothing was donne this day by meanes all the <i>tonos</i> vizeted
  the Emperour with presents.</p>
<p>And news came to Cort of the death of one of themperours doughters, whoe
  was married to a great prince.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 21.</i>&mdash;I went this mornyng to Miaco, to vizet the
  Coreans, leving capt. Adames to follow sute at Court; but I could not
  be permitted to speak with the Coreans per meanes of the King of Tushma,
  he being gelouse we might get trade into Corea, which non other are
  permitted but the Tushmeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 22.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Mr. Wickham not to goe any
  more to Tushma Tono, nor his secretary, till he heard ferther from
  me, I haveing now emploid Cacayemon Dono to speake to Oyen Dono, his
  master, to know his pleasure, whether I might be admitted speech with
  the Coreans or no.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames went againe to the Court and there remeaned all day till
  toward night, and then the councell sent the King of Englandes letter
  to be translated into the Japon tong, which was donne, and he willed
  to retorne againe to morow.</p>
<p>This day all the Japon lords or <i>tonos</i> went to vizet the Corean
  ambassadors, carrying them greate presentes, a matter strang to see,
  except it be they be set on per the Emperour to withdraw them from
  favoring the King of China, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 23.</i>&mdash;I sent an other letter to Mr. Wickham with
  the coppie of translation of King Englandes letter, to have Jean Dono
  to write out two more.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames retorned from the Court with answer from the councell that
  the Emperour would geve our Englishe nation no larger previlegese then
  other strangers have, only to sell our merchandiz at Firando and Langasaque.
  The reason he doth it is for that his owne merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> of Japon shall have the profit of seling within land
  before strangers, as also that, under culler of buying and seling,
  noe pristes may lurk up and downe his cuntrey to alter religion as
  heretofore they have donne. Of the which I advised Mr. Wickham in an
  other letter, to thentent he use diligence to sell somthing, for that
  we shall not be sufferd to stay long after the Emperour is departed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 24.</i>&mdash;I went this mornyng to Safian Dono to confer
  about our matter of procese with scrivano, which he desired might stay
  till he came downe to Langasaque, which should be shortly. Also he
  tooke notis of what merchandiz we had to sell, and wrot a letter to
  Gonrok Dono to take all lead for the Emperour and pay us ready money.</p>
<p>Torazemon Dono came to vizet me, telling me that Semi Dono was at Court
  all this day to sue for his master the <i>Tono</i> of Firando to retorne
  for his howse or cuntrey, being very sick; but could have no answer.
  He said the Kyng (or <i>Tono</i>) of Xaxma retorned for his cuntrey
  yisterday, and to morow the <i>Tonos</i> of Umbra and Goto have lycense
  to departe.</p>
<p>Ther is 2 noble men taken and brought to Court, their castell being overthrowne,
  wherin was fownd store of war-lik provition of poulder, shot, guns,
  and armor, but for what pretence I canot understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;I wrot Mr. Wickham an other letter, in answer
  of his rec. the night past, to make sales of silk, yf it be possible.</p>
<p>Yisterday, Oyen Dono, Codgskin Dono, and other of the Emperours councell
  went to Miaco to vizet the Coreans, with a present from themperour,
  so that we could doe nothing tuchng our dispach. But this mornyng Capt.
  Adames went to Court about it, with our <i>jurebasso</i>, and at night
  left our writeings with them to alter or amend them at their pleasure
  and geve us ij <i>goshons</i> for Cochinchina and Syam.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Mr. Wickham wrot me he had sould a small quantety of silk at 218 <i>ta.
  pico</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 26.</i>&mdash;I wrot an other letter to Mr. Wickham to sell
  10 or 12 chistes more of silk, although it weare at 215 <i>tais pico</i> to
  delivr it at Firando; for that money we must needes have to send in
  this shipp, at what price soever we sell; and, now our prevelegese
  are lost, we must not stay heare to procure sales; and we knew well
  ther were no merchantes beloe, so that now the tyme to goe thorow or
  never.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames went againe to Court, but did nothing.</p>
<p>And Semi Dono sent me a letter to procure out a <i>goshon</i> for hym
  for a junk to goe for Tonkyn. But I retorned hym answer, he should
  pardon me, for I had so much to doe with the lordes of the councell
  the other day about my owne matters that I had no desire to enter into
  other mens nor trouble them any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 27.</i>&mdash;I wrot a letter to Firando with the 3 barelles
  brimston, and sent it per Sinda Dono of Sackay, to send for Firando
  per first. In this letter I advized of all is past, and that I think
  it will be 15 or 20 daies before I shall be ready to goe for Firando,
  and that they shall mak sales of any sort merchandiz.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames went againe to the Cort, but was referred till to morrow
  for dispach.</p>
<p>Divers noble men sent to buy broad cloth and fustions, but I referd them
  till Mr. Wickham came from Miaco, telling them I knew not whether any
  such thinges were left ungeven or no, for I canot tell whether it be
  donne to know whether we will sell heare or no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 28.</i>&mdash;I wrot Mr. Wickham answer of his letter rec.
  to make an end of Grubstreet, our host, about the difference of his
  refusing his bargin of silk bought; for I knew not whether he did it
  of purpose to bring the matter before the justice to make it knowne
  we sell goodes above, contrary to themperours edict.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>
<p>And afterward Mr. Wickham came hym selfe to Fushamy to aske councell about
  our proceadinges to make sales; and soe retorned for Miaco againe.
  And sent by the man carid my letter in the mornyng 10 saks of rozen
  or pitch, each waying 70 <i>cattis</i>, is 7 <i>picos</i> at 3 <i>tais</i> the <i>picull</i>.
  It be excellent good and duble the goodnes of former we bought at Langasaque.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames remeaned most parte of day at Court to get our writinges
  and dispach; and in the end left our <i>jurebasso</i> to bring them
  away when they weare sealed. But when the griffer or clark should have
  geven them, he demanded the delivering in of our ould <i>goshon</i> (or
  pasport) for our junk for Syam, which we had not, our junk not being
  arived nor no newes of her at our departure from Firando.</p>
<p>This day the Emperours two brothers came to viset hym, one being 16 years
  ould, houlding the castell of Shrongo, and the other som 2 yeares yonger,
  houlding the castell at Langaw: two of the strongest fortresses in
  Japon. So that all the <i>tonos</i> of Japon went to accompany them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 29.</i>&mdash;I wrot an other letter to Mr. Wickham to look
  out for Shoby Dono, to the entent to sell our junk to hym; and rec.
  answer, he is not at Miaco. So I think he keepeth hym selfe out of
  way of purpose, for that he oweth som 250 <i>taies</i> to Hon<sup>ble</sup> Company.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames was all day at Cort with our <i>jurebasso</i>, and in the
  end got our writinges sealed. But, as they weare ready to be deliverd,
  in reading our previlegese over, som one tooke exception that Langasaque
  was put in as well as Firando. And soe they staid them till the next
  day, to take <i>danco</i>, in parte that Oyen Dono, themperours secretary,
  was abcent by means of the death of his wife newly happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>September 30.</i>&mdash;I wrot an other letter to Mr. Wickham not to
  trust Semi Dono nor any other with broad cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> except they brought ready money, nether to send the
  cloth to any of their howses, but let them com to our lodging and see
  it.</p>
<p>Capt. Adames went this mornyng to Court againe to get out our <i>goshon</i>,
  and had them deliverd to hym sealed before nowne, Langasaque being
  put in as well as Firando. But he was willed to stay till the rest
  of the councell came, to see them read our [<i>goshon</i>] before he
  went away; which in the end was donne. But Tushma Dono and others tooke
  exceptions that Langasaque was put in, and soe would not let it passe
  but altered it as before. Whereupon Capt. Adames replied that we cared
  not to have our shiping goe for Langasaque, but only to sell our merchandiz.
  Unto which Tushma Dono answerd that we might doe soe without puting
  any word into our previlegese, having a letter formerly to that entent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 1</i> (<i>12th Conguach</i>).&mdash;I wrot an other letter
  to Mr. Wickham of recept of his, as also that at present I had receved
  a letter from Semi Dono, whoe very ernestly desireth to have vij <i>tatta</i> broad
  cloth, to pay for it 6 wickes hence at his arivall at Firando. So I
  advised Mr. Wickham to let hym have it, taking his bill for payment,
  and, yf he will pay any ready money, to receve it and put it on the
  bill or shorten it on acco.</p>
<p>I desird Capt. Adames to goe againe to Cort, to get Goto and Shashma put
  in for shiping, yf in case the <i>Tono</i> of Firando did misuse us,
  as, to say the truth, I can not bragg of any good usadg, yet lothe
  to complaine. As also that thenglish desire to be in a place apart
  from the Hollanders, as being of divers conditions. Yet, when all was
  donne, we were glad to rest contented with matters as they formerly
  were. And so Capt. Adames brought our previleges with 2 <i>goshons</i>,
  1 for Syam and the other for Cochinchina.</p>
<p>And themperour sent me word he would make noe answer to the King of Englandes
  letter, nor send present, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[
  317]</a></span> being directed to his deceased father, a thing helde
  ominous in Japon, but withall sent me a <i>cattan</i> and 10 coates,
  and 10 coates to Capt. Adames, whereof we gave ether of us one coate
  to Torazemon Dono, whome brought these thinges from themperour.</p>
<p>Also I rec. a letter from Capt. Whaw, the China, with a present of a jar
  green ginger. This China which brought it came to get out a <i>goshon</i> for
  Cochinchina.</p>
<p>And I rec. letters from Firando, dated the 7th, 8, and 9th ultimo, of
  arivall <i>Sea Adventure</i> from Syam at Firando, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 letter from Mr. Jno. Johnson and Richard Pit in Syam, May, 1616.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Jno. Ferrers, from same place.</p>
<p class="blockquot">4 from Mr. Eaton, 2 dated in Tushma and 2 in Firando.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Nealson, dated in Firando.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Osterwick in Firando.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Totton in Firando.</p>
<p class="blockquot">1 from Mr. Borges in Firando.</p>
<p>By which letters I also rec. our ould <i>goshon</i> from Syam, and delivered
  it in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 2.</i>&mdash;I sent two letters to Mr. Wickham per our host,
  one from Mr. Eaton and thother from Mr. Osterwick for hym selfe, with
  one of Mr. Eatons and another of Mr. Burges of myne to shew how hard
  a passadg our junk had.</p>
<p>And soe Capt. Adames and I went to Oyen Donos to take our leave, where
  we met Codgkin Dono and all the rest of the councell, who were ready
  to set forward with the Emperour towardes Edo, he gooing to Otes<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> to

1 to Mr. Totton and Mr.
  Bourges; and the fourth was to Mr. Jno. Johnson and Ric. Pittes for
  Syam, to be sent in a junk from Langasaque.
All these letters I sent
  per Synda
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> Dono with the 7 <i>pico.</i> rozen, to send both letters
  and rozen forthwith for Firando ether from Osakay or Sakay, with 3
  or 400 <i>gantes</i> fysh oyle, yf it be to be had; and to that purpose
  wrot 2 letters to our host at Osakay and ostis at Sakay. Also I sent
  2 letters to China Capt. and Matinga.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>October 3.</i>&mdash;We went this mornyng to Miaco, to dispache our

</p>
<p>And I thought good to note downe that in the way from Miaco our host shewed
  us the preparatives made for the buriall of the ould <i>dyrie</i> (or
  pope) of Japon, viz.:&mdash;In one howse was set a rood or shrine of
  marvelose lardgnes, with, to my thinking, 100 pillers gilded over with
  gould, with each of them a gilded crowne on the top of them, and rownd
  about the howse, against the pillers, a gilded skuchin hanged up, which,
  as I learned, represented all the provinces or kingdoms in Japon, over
  which he houldeth hym selfe king of kings. Also against each piller
  stood a candelstick with a wax taper. But yow must understand there
  was an other howse, built highe and 4 square, not far from this first
  with the shrine, in the midest wherof was a dipe hole very fairely
  plastered, over which a greate vessell of wood was to be placed, wherin
  the body of the <i>dirie</i> was to be put, and the valt under filled
  with sweete odors and pretious woods, which being set on fire burne
  the vessells, corps, howse, and all the rest; with 4 gates made E.,
  W., N., and S., walled about a pretty distance from the howse, all
  being hanged about with white silk which was to be consumed with the
  rest.</p>
<p>The greate wooden vessell I saw in a pagod not far from the place wheare
  the body was to be burned, which pagod was fownded per the said <i>daire</i>.
  The vessell in forme was made lyke a lantarne, set out with pinacles
  of excellent workmanship, all being gilded over with gould.</p>
<p>The top of the howse where he was to be burned was painted with the formes
  of angells, som with instrumentes of musick and others with garlandes,
  as it were to crowne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> hym. And they verely think that, when the body is consumed,
  the sole flieth directly for heaven, haveing liberty to passe out at
  any of the 4 gates, eather E., W., N., or S.</p>

  worth about 200 <i>taies</i>.</p>
<p>I also made sale to China Capt. of Capt. Adames junk with the <i>goshon</i>,

  run away with our table lynen he had to wash, wishing them to look
  out theare for hym.</p>
<p>The Hollandes generall sent me a runlet of Canare wyne, exskewsing hym
  selfe to com to dyner on Sonday, for that he fownd hym selfe ill at
  ease and tooke phisick. But I doe rather esteem he taks state upon
  hym. Yet, be it ether one occation or other, I sent hym word he should
  be wellcom yf he pleased to com, and that I made no dowbt, although
  he were ill at ease now, yt might please God he might be well againe
  before Sonday, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaton and Mr. Totton retorned from Langasaque to Firando this night.
  And the China Capt. Whawe lent them his <i>foy fone</i>. But som of
  the rowers stole a small silver cup of the Companies out of Mr. Tottons
  chist in carrying it abord.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaton tells me that a Spaniard called Miguell de Salines would have
  taken away our caffro Antony, set free per King of Firando, geving
  out great wordes that he would spend 4000 <i>taies</i> but he would
  have hym. But Mr. Eaton tould hym his wordes would not prevaile, and
  therefore wished hym to com to me and aske hym, otherwais he had nothing
  to say to hym.</p>
<p>I, upon good consyderation, let the China Capt. and his brother, Capt.
  Whow, have our 2 lesser bras fowlers with their 4 chambers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 28.</i>&mdash;I delivered Capt. Adames <i>goshon</i> to Skydayen
  Dono, whoe is partner in buying his junk, in presence of the China
  Capt., when it was delivered. And we sould all the rest of our skins
  of Syam to Croby Donos kynsman, for 20 <i>taies</i> for 100 skins.</p>
<p>This mornyng an ould man came from Jor. Durois to trym our frute trees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>November 30.</i>&mdash;I rec. a letter from Mr. Wickham of report popish
  miracles, how a mans arme was drid up for offring to burne a fryres
  cope or vestment, his arme standing stiff out, he not being able to
  pul it back nor bend it. Thus doe these popish pristes envent lies
  to deceave the pore symple people.</p>
<p>The fryre that was taken at mas was called Padre Appolenarius, and was
  taken in Arima; but the Christians rose up in armes against the Emperours
  offecers, and tooke hym per force. So what will com of it is uncerten.
  Yt was this mans cope or vestment which he left behind hym which wrought
  this miracle, as the papists report; but yow may beleeve it yf yow
  please.</p>
<p>The Hollanders came all to dyner, except the generall and Mr. Barkhoult,
  they being sick of a fever, as the others report.</p>
<p>The master of the <i>Galleas</i> and the secretary sent me a <i>barica</i> of
  Spanish wyne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 1.</i>&mdash;I envited all the Chinas to dyner, which came
  to the ceremonies of China Capt. child, in respect of the overplus
  left of enviting the Hollanders. Soe it cost not much, they being above
  20 persons.</p>
<p>Capt. Speck came hym selfe to desyre me to let hym have one peece of canvas
  (or poledavis) for a sample to trye to make other by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 2.</i>&mdash;The China Capt. departed towardes Langasaque
  with all the other Chinas with hym which came to vizet hym for the
  berth of his child.</p>
<p>Jno. Derckson Lamb, the Hollandes generall, came to vizet me at English
  howse, exskewsing hym selfe he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> not to dyner the other day, in respect he was sick
  and newly let blood, soe that his chirurgion councelled hym not to
  goe; otherwais no other occation should have staid hym. So I made hym
  colation in the best sort I could.</p>
<p>Mr. Osterwick rec. 931 <i>ta.</i> 5 <i>m.</i> 0 <i>co.</i> of Croby Donos
  kynsman, for 4050 deare skins at 23 <i>taies</i> per 100 skins, in
  bars of Nagita. At which tyme I deliverd back the chist of 1000 <i>tais</i> plate
  bars rec. at Dembo, neare Osakay, of Croby Dono upon acco. of goods
  sould upon conditions, viz. silke, yf it were not sould before. But
  being sould before my arivall at Firando, I retorned the money back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  from the fiscall.</p>

  English man, to thank me for being the meanes to get the 3 souldiers
  pardoned. Yt seemes Capt. Speck was much against it, and urged the
  generall to tell hym he was thoccation of that had happened in leaving
  open the windoes, otherwise no such matter had byn attempted; and,
  yf he well bethought hym selfe, these men had spent their blood in
  getting those goodes, and lost all they had when thadmerall ship was
  sunk, so that a more charetable mynd were better;
  &ldquo;and yet (said he) I am no man that will mentayne theft. And had

  promised the one halfe.</p>
<p>The Hollandes generall sent me a Hollandes cheese per Albartus, puting
  me and rest in mynd to com to morow to dyner. Yt seemeth they had not
  greatly cared yf we had not promised to com to dyner, in respect the
  world might have esteemed they respected us not yf they had not don
  it, which made me to goe, not for a dyner, etc.</p>

  withall sent me word that the loving kyndnes he had receved from me
  in espetiall could never be forgotten whiles he lived, knowing well
  it came from a good hart, wishing the English else where were of my
  opinion and caradg, and then he durst presume there would be no ill
  will betwixt the English and Hollanders.</p>
<p>The China Capt., Andrea Dittis, retorned this mornyng from Langasaque,

  of his lyfe, and wounded and meamed 7 or 8 men, but non slaine, and
  was in greate danger to have fyred all the gunpolder, being 200 barilles;
  which cauced the fiskall, Mr. Albartus, and the secretary to leape
  overbord into the sea. Two of them, not being abell to swym, had lyke

<p>Divers passingers which ment to have gon in our junk against my will (for
  Syam) went and complayned to Taccamon Dono to have passag perforce,
  and to that entent he sent me word. But I retorned answer I had the
  Emperours <i>goshon</i> to entertayne or send whome I listed, in paying

  and 3 out of the <i>Gallias</i>, viz. admerall, taking my visetation
  in very kynd part.</p>
<p>I gave the China Capt. a <i>kerymon</i> of silk for his doughter to sleepe

  Dono said our junk should not goe out for Syam except I sufferd each
  offecer to carry 2 passingers, according to the custom of the cuntrey.
  Also others said that our junk was falne into an extreame leake. And
  the therd news was that Langasaque was set on fyre. For the two first,
  of the wordes of Taccamon Dono and junkes leake, I think it rather
  the knavery of the unruly mareners, whoe wish it might be soe, then
  otherwaies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I forgot to note downe how I went to vizet the <i>tono</i> yisternight,
  and carid hym a jar conservs, and Capt. Adames carid hym a <i>barso</i> wyne
  and 2 fyshes. I tould hym our junk was ready to departe towardes Syam,
  offring hym to doe hym any service in that place we could, which he
  took in good parte, promesing all frenshipp he could towardes our nation,
  and with all thanking me for the frenshipp I showed hym at his being
  at Miaco, and telling me I should have barkes ready to toe out our
  junk at my pleasure, etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>
<p>Our junk being ready to goe out, Taccamon Dono sent me word that, except
  I would alow of 10 passingers to goe in her, we should have no boates
  to toe her out, nether would he suffer our offecers to goe in the junk.
  So the tyde not tarryng for the kyng (as the proverb is), I hired 2
  boates by meanes of Capt. Adames, and two I set out my selfe, and the
  Hollanders sent their <i>foy fone</i>, and the China Capt. an other
  bark, and the <i>Adviz</i> sent her boate; with which we got out our
  junk, contrary to their expectation, and carid her into Cochy roade.
  Yet this Taccamon Dono cauced the Japans hostes to our offecers to
  stay them. Wherupon I was forced to goe to the king to complaine, but
  could not com to speech of hym. So the junk was forced to stay all
  this day, and loose a fayre wynde. And within night this Taccamon Dono
  sent 3 or 4 men (as coming from the kyng) to have passadg for 3 men,
  and got the China Capt. to com to speake for them; but I denid them
  all.</p>
<p>Oyen Dono sent me word the king had reproved Taccamon Dono and bad hym
  not meddell in our busynes.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaton had one hundred <i>taies</i> alowed hym on his wagis, and I
  paid hym my selfe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>December 31.</i>&mdash;This day Taccamon Dono sent againe to the hostes
  howses of our junk offecers, charging them not to let the offecers
  departe till I agreed to let the passingers passe in our junk. So I
  was forced againe to get Capt. Adames to goe to the kyng, with our <i>jurebasso</i> in
  his company, to complaine of the wrong Taccamon Dono doth us, our junk
  being now ready to goe out. So the kyng gave order forthwith to the
  hostes to let them goe. And sowne after Taccamon Dono sent to me to
  exskeuse hym selfe, saying he was ill enformed of my matter by the
  passingers, and therefore craved pardon. This Taccamon Dono is a prowd,
  humerose, dreamyng fello.</p>
<p>After dyner, Mr. Eaton went abord the junk to Cochy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> and carid all the marreners with hym; but
  the wether did groe so boysterous, and blew soe hard a
  gale wynd, that they were in danger to have perished. And,
  as report goeth, ther is above 30 barkes cast away, laden
  with rise and other merchandiz, coming from Langasaque,
  Fingo, Xaxma, and those partes, and all or most parte of
  people drowned.</p>

    1600 to 1689. I have found this book most useful; and some of
    the information which it gives cannot be obtained elsewhere,
    owing to the loss of original papers. Rundall, also, in his <i>Memorials

    that they made accompt it was not unknowne unto us the order

    his dominions, alowing the Spaniards and Portingales no port
    to enter into, but only Amacau; yt being but a littell point
    or rock of noe emportance. Unto which I replied that their previleges
    were far better then ours, in respect they pay no duties but
    only a certain sum of money for ancorage of their shipps, neither
    were bound to goe to the Emperours court with any present yearely,
    as we doe, spending more money in going up and downe then the
    ancorage of their shipping cometh unto. As also the Portingales
    of Amacau have lycense to goe yearely to the greate cittie of
    Canton both to buy and sell such commodities as they have, and
    had boates provided by the King of China to carry them up and
    downe with their goods. So that I wished the Emperour of Japan
    would make our previleges equall with the Portingales at Amacau.

    left a will, drawn up apparently in duplicate, in English and
    Japanese. It was formerly preserved in the archives of the East
    India Company. In the MS. volume, T. (b), vol. i. <i>Supplement
    to China Materials</i>, the English document is referred to as
    being among the &ldquo;Collection of wills&rdquo;, and the Japanese
    version as among &ldquo;Foreign papers&rdquo;. In 1850, Mr. Rundall
    appears to have seen the Japanese, but not the English, version,
    for he states that &ldquo;the will of William Adams, in Japanese,
    is preserved among the records of the Honourable the East India
    Company&rdquo;, but that
    &ldquo;a translation has not been traced&rdquo; (<i>Memorials of
    the Empire of Japon</i>, p. 87). He also quotes the Inventory
    of the Estate of Capt. William Adams, showing that the value
    of the property was about ¬£500. I regret to say that these documents
    cannot now be found in the India Office, although, by the kindness
    of Mr. C. C. Prinsep, I have had every assistance in making a
    search. </p>
  <p> Mr. Griffis, in <i>The Mikado&rsquo;s Empire</i>, 1876, p. 262, gives
    the following interesting particulars respecting Adams and his
    last resting-place:&mdash;&ldquo;Will Adams had a son and daughter
    born to him in Japan, and there are still living Japanese who
    claim descent from him. One of the streets of Yedo was named
    after him Anjin Ch&#333; (Pilot Street), and the people of that
    street still hold an annual celebration on the 15th of June in
    his honor, one of which I attended in 1873. When Adams died,
    he, and afterwards his Japanese wife, were buried on the summit
    of one of the lovely hills overlooking the Bay of Yedo, Goldsborough
    Inlet, and the surrounding beautiful and classic landscape. Adams
    chose the spot himself. The people of Yedo erected memorial-stone
    lanterns at his tomb. Parry&rsquo;s fleet, in 1854, anchored within
    the very shadow of the Englishman&rsquo;s sepulchre. In May, 1872,
    Mr. Walter, of Yokohama, after a study of Hildreth and some search,
    discovered the tomb which others had sought for in vain. Two
    neat stone shafts in the characteristic style of native monumental
    architecture, set on a stone pediment, mark the spot. I visited
    it, in company of the bonze in charge of the Shin shin temple
    of the village, in July, 1873.&rdquo;</p>

    Samme is Iy√©yasu, the founder of the Tokugawa dynasty of Shoguns,
    which lasted down to the revolution of 1868. <i>Samme</i>, as
    Cock writes it, is <i>Sama</i>, a title of respect appended to
    the name. Fidaia Samme is Hideyori, son of the famous Hideyoshi,
    the great warrior, better known as Taiko Sama. Hideyoshi, although
    holding supreme power, never received the title of Shogun. On
    his death he named his son Hideyori, then a child of six years,
    his successor, appointing at the same time a council of regency,
    in which Iy√©yasu held the chief place. Iy√©yasu&rsquo;s increasing power
    and popularity naturally roused the jealousy of others, the result
    being a struggle between an eastern army under Iy√©yasu, and a
    western army led by his rivals and supporters of Hideyori. His
    great victory at Sekigahara, in 1600, confirmed the power of
    Iy√©yasu for many years. In 1603, he was created Shogun by the
    Mikado. But Hideyori was not yet disposed of. He rose against
    Iy√©yasu in 1614, but was besieged in Osaka; and a truce was patched
    up. But almost immediately Hideyori was again in arms with a
    following of 120,000 men, and intrenched himself at Osaka. The
    place was stormed, Hideyori&rsquo;s troops were utterly defeated, and
    he and his mother perished. Rumours of his escape lived for a
    long time among the people, and are frequently noticed in the
    course of this Diary. Klaproth, <i>Annales des Empereurs du Japon</i> (London,
    1734), p. 410, gives the following account: &ldquo;Quelques officiers
    de l&rsquo;arm√©e de Fide yori mirent le feu au ch√¢teau d&rsquo;Osaka, pour
    se concilier les bonnes gr√¢ces de Ye yasou, mais ils furent arr√™t√©s
    dans leur fuite par les gens de Fide yori et mis √† mort. Comme
    il n&rsquo;√©tait pas possible d&rsquo;√©teindre l&rsquo;incendie, Fide yori se sauva
    dans le Fiougo, o√π il s&rsquo;embarqua pour le Satsouma sur les b√¢timens
    de cette province, qu&rsquo;on y avait tenus √† sa disposition en cas
    de besoin. On pr√©tendit qu&rsquo;il avait p√©ri dans l&rsquo;incendie de ce
    ch√¢teau, mais ce n&rsquo;√©tait qu&rsquo;un bruit r√©pandu pour favoriser sa
    fuite.&rdquo;</p>
